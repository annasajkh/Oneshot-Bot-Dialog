Let's hope the charged battery does something!

Whoa!

That's a big machine!

It doesn't seem to be doing anything, though...

There's a rectangle-shaped hole in the middle.

Looks like something used to fit in here...

Some sort of small machine.

niko:
I wonder what it does?

niko:
I can feel my hair standing up a little...

It's a power cell...
I think.

Oh!

The word "Prophetbot" is written on the side.

Dusty shelves.

Looks like a press used to crush metal.

niko:
Ah... do you want me to crush the pipe in here, Player?

niko:
Ohh, but I don't wanna get too close...

niko:
...

niko:
That was scary...

niko:
....Player !

niko:
I am NOT going to put the sun here.

niko:
Why... would you want to smash a bottle here, Player?

niko:
The shards would get everywhere!

niko:
I hope we don't have to use this again, Player...

niko:
Oh! This machine is still running!

niko:
Maybe I shouldn't stand so close to it...

niko:
Wh...what if my scarf got caught in there? And then it'll pull me in, and....

niko:
...not gonna finish that sentence.

niko:
...just a head. Yikes.

What's left of a robot's arm.

A robot. It's beyond repair...

You want me use the crowbar to open the safe, Player?
I'll... try!

The door is sealed flush! We might need the code after all...

A metal safe.
Seems like it's locked with a 6-digit code.

I don't... remember seeing any 6-digit codes. Do you, Player?

Woah! It worked!

Wait, how did you know the code,

I still don't remember seeing one...

Really?
From who?

Okay...

I...see!

Oh! Right.
Let's see...

Ah! I found a gas mask!

Also... there's this weird-looking book!

niko:
I can't read it, though...

niko:
...not that I can't read or anything! Because I can!

I just don't know what language this is...

That wasn't it...

It's empty.

I see!

Strange black plants. They look like clovers.

It's a crate.

Something is poking out from this shelf.

niko:
Ah...it's a screwdriver.

silver:
[You can take it if you want. It may help you.]

niko:
Oh! Are you sure?

silver:
[Yes. I have many.]

niko:
Thank you!

silver:
[Please do not touch that.]

niko:
Oh!

niko:
Sorry... I got curious...

...what is this thing?

silver:
[Back-up power cell. It keeps me functional.]

silver:
[The main generator for the Barrens ran out of power some time ago.]

silver:
[It could not even last a week without the sun.]

Sorry to hear that...

silver:
[All we can do is make use of the light we have.]

This is some kind of power cell, apparently!

The word "SILVER" is written on the side.

Why does it say that?

[That's not important.]

Okay...

Ow!

I got shocked...

[I told you not to touch it...]

Player made me.

I'm not falling for that one again, Player...

Oh?

Not even... with the other robots?

[No.]
[Nobody in the Barrens have that capacity in their programming.]

It's made of metal...?

There's lots of tiny glowing shrimp swimming in this jar.

It's a photo of two people.

The glass is a bit too foggy to see details, though.

silver:
[Oh, it's that journal you showed me in the mines.]

silver:
[Doesn't look like it's glowing anymore, though.]

niko:
Do you know what I'm supposed to do with it?

silver:
[I am unsure, but...]

silver:
[...hold on to the journal for now.]

silver:
[It will be important.]

niko:
O...kay...

niko:
Excuse me, miss...

niko:
I found this book.
Do you know anything about it?

silver:
[Let me see...]

silver:
[What language is this...?]

silver:
[I'm sorry, I... don't even recognize this writing system.]

niko:
Ah, well, it was worth a shot.

silver:
[Although...this insignia.]

silver:
[...]

silver:
[...hold on to the journal for now.]

silver:
[It will be important.]

niko:
O...kay...

silver:
[Off you go...]

silver:
[There's no reason for you to linger in the Barrens.]

niko:
Excuse me again, miss...

niko:
I found a robot who can take me towards the Tower!

niko:
...but it's having some trouble, so it told me to talk to you.

silver:
[Alright.
What is the issue?]

niko:
It said something about its navigation circuits being fried.

silver:
[Just the navigation circuits?]

niko:
Apparently!
Player and I fixed everything else, I think...

silver:
[Hm...]

silver:
[I have something that may help.]

silver:
[Rowbots have the ability to trace material from their source locations.]

silver:
[If you let the rowbot borrow this, then its backup tracking system should activate.]

niko:
That's a very pretty necklace!

niko:
What's it made of?

silver:
[Amber found from the Glen.]

niko:
What's the thing inside the amber?

silver:
[The black clover?
That's a common plant in our world.]

silver:
[It's also...]

silver:
[...]

niko:
?

silver:
[Sigh...I'm not sure if I can bear to part with this.]

silver:
[My programming says yes, but I still feel conflicted.]

niko:
...?

silver:
[Nevermind.]

silver:
[You need to finish your mission more than I need a keepsake.]

silver:
[Here.]

niko:
Oh, thank you!

silver:
[Do you need further assistance?]

niko:
We're good, thanks!

niko:
What's inside the Tower?

silver:
[I don't know. Nobody's ever entered it before.]

silver:
[At least, nobody history knows.]

niko:
Then... who built it?

silver:
[Built?]

silver:
[As far as anyone can tell, it's been there since the beginning of time.]

silver:
[I know someone who wanted to study it before, but...]

silver:
[...]

niko:
Oh?

silver:
[He never told me if it went anywhere.]

silver:
[The lightbulb...]

silver:
[So, are you the "messiah"?]

niko:
That's what I've been told.

silver:
[I expected someone...taller.]

silver:
[Or at least someone that doesn't look like a kitten.]

silver:
[That's what you are, right? Some sort of cat?]

niko:
Nuh-uh!

niko:
I'm a person!

silver:
[You got the eyes of a cat...]

niko:
But cats walk on four legs!

silver:
[Well, either way...]

silver:
[A child like you being the messiah...just doesn't feel right.]

niko:
But that robot back there says there's no mistake...

silver:
[I know.]

silver:
[...sigh.]

silver:
[This is going to sound cold, but...]

silver:
[I honestly think you are better off just...leaving and letting the world die naturally.]

silver:
[The world has been falling apart for a long time.]

silver:
[This manner of decay...It's highly unprobable that the sun can fix it.]

silver:
[You've already seen how bad it can get, right?]

niko:
We...haven't seen much of anything, actually...

niko:
And we can't really just leave...

silver:
[Oh, so you just got here?]

silver:
[Then you must be headed towards the Tower.]

niko:
M-hm!

niko:
It's where I'm supposed put the lightbulb... er, sun, isn't it?

silver:
[Yes, at the very top.]

silver:
[We know that the Tower contains a force that nobody could comprehend.]

silver:
[And the power is strongest at the summit.]

silver:
[Maybe it will send you back home after you complete your mission.]

niko:
Oh!

silver:
[Don't take my word for it, though.]

niko:
Before I go... Is there anything I can do in return?

silver:
[Actually...]

silver:
[Do you... know how to play chess?]

niko:
Yeah!
Well, sort of...

niko:
I've played it with some older kids before!

silver:
[Then, will you play a game with me?]

niko:
I mean, I don't know the rules very well....

niko:
But I guess it's the least I could do!

niko:
You're really good at this!

silver:
[Thank you.
It was built into my code.]

niko:
Ah.

niko:
So.... What's it like?
Being a robot and all...

niko:
I've talked to other robots, and they all say something about programming and code and stuff.

niko:
Even you did, just now!

niko:
It's a little hard to understand sometimes.

silver:
[I know.]

silver:
[Most of the robots here are not tamed.]

niko:
Tamed?

silver:
[Watch out.]

niko:
...there goes my bishop...

silver:
[Taming... is complicated.]

niko:
Oh?

niko:
How complicated, exactly?

silver:
[...]

niko:
...there goes my other bishop...

silver:
[I can't really explain what tamed robots are.]

silver:
[But I'm one of them.]

silver:
[All the other tamed robots have been moved to other regions.]

silver:
[Exactly where, I don't know.]

niko:
Oh?

silver:
[...]

niko:
...there goes my little horse...

silver:
[Knight.]

niko:
Right...

niko:
Oh! Have you ever been to any other regions?
I heard that there's two more.

silver:
[In the past, yes.]

silver:
[I still have the data, the coordinates, the memories...]

silver:
[...I don't know how much of that still holds true.]

silver:
[The world may be a very different place now.]

niko:
Because the sun is gone?

silver:
[No.]

silver:
[I said this already, didn't I?]

silver:
[The sun probably won't save the world.]

silver:
[The decaying started back before the sun went out.]

silver:
[The sun's sudden death was just the tipping point, and things went south really fast after that.]

niko:
Oh...

niko:
Then... there's nothing I can do?

silver:
[Check.]

niko:
W-what!

niko:
When did your queen get there...

silver:
[The only thing you can do is complete your pilgrimage.]

silver:
[In a way, you are only supposed to be a second chance for the people.]

silver:
[Just like how the Barrens was only supposed to be a second chance for me.]

silver:
[There's no guarantee that things will work out.]

niko:
But...

silver:
[Checkmate.]

niko:
...

silver:
[Alright, guess I've kept you long enough...]

silver:
[...Thank you for listening.]

silver:
[I hope you get home safely.]

niko:
Ah, thank you also!

niko:
It's a crate.

silver:
[Wait!]

silver:
[I saw you heading towards this direction.]

silver:
[The mines have been abandoned for a long time, I cannot guarantee that it's safe.]

silver:
[If you must enter it, it is my duty to accompany you at least once.]

Oh, thanks!

The entrance is roped off...
And there's a sign 

here:

unknown:

WARNING:

Visitors must see the Head Engineer for permission to enter the mines.

niko:
I guess we should find the Head Engineer...

silver:
[I'll be waiting here if you need me.]

silver:
[Maybe you should inspect the journal a bit closer....]

silver:
[Do be careful in here.]

silver:
[Ready to leave?]

niko:
Mhm.

niko:
It'd be rude to leave now...

niko:
Safety violation!

niko:
The yellow light is gone now.

niko:
Must've imagined it...

niko:
...

silver:
[Are you okay?]

silver:
[You were starting to black out...]

niko:
I...
I saw something?

silver:
[?]

niko:
It was like a really short dream, just now.

silver:
[Oh?]

niko:
I saw something like...
A robot, with a yellow eye...

silver:
[...that's...
..strange.]

silver:
[Are you sure you're okay?]

niko:
...yeah.

silver:
[...You know, now that you have mentioned it.]

silver:
[There is a robot who always insisted on going back to the abandoned mines.]

silver:
[...despite how long the mines have been in disrepair.]

silver:
[I hope he's okay.]

niko:
He doesn't look broken or anything...

niko:
...but I didn't really... SEE him see him, yknow?

niko:
Like I said, it was kinda like a dream...

niko:
And he was up close!

silver:
[Sounds like some kind of visual glitch.]

silver:
[Or... hallucination.]
[Whatever it is that living beings have.]

niko:
Hm...

niko:
Does the robot you know of have a yellow eye?

niko:
I don't think I've seen any other robots like that...

silver:
[I would not know.]

silver:
[I never met him myself. Only heard of him from a friend of mine.]

niko:
Your friend, huh...

niko:
Hold on... something in my pocket is...

niko:
What's...

niko:
That wasn't glowing before!

niko:
What IS this...?

silver:
[That... was going to be my question.]

silver:
[Where did you... get that book?]

niko:
Oh, uh...

niko:
It was with me when I woke up back at the house.

niko:
I didn't really question it at the time...

niko:
I flipped through a couple of pages, but I don't understand a word!

niko:
Is that just something messiahs are supposed to wake up with?

silver:
[No... I have never heard of anything like that.]

silver:
[But I... know who wrote the book.]

niko:
Oh?

silver:
[However...]

silver:
[I've only seen his books with a black clover on the cover.]

silver:
[If he went through the trouble of putting yellow phosphor in it...]

silver:
[And the fact that you woke up with it in the first place...]

silver:
[...Really has me intrigued.]

niko:
Yellow... phosphor?

niko:
Oh yeah! That's the rare phosphor that people think the sun is made of, right?

niko:
...

niko:
...wait a minute, how do I know this?

niko:
I don't think anyone's told me about it...

silver:
[Ah... I can show you if you'd like.]

silver:
[My friend gave me this a long time ago.]

niko:
Pretty!

niko:
Oh! Looks like there's a clover in the necklace too!

niko:
...like the book!

silver:
[Well... it IS the same person.]

niko:
Oooh.

silver:
[That's... why I think this journal would be important.]

silver:
[You said it JUST started glowing?]

niko:
Yeah?

silver:
[That was right after your vision, then...]

silver:
[...This HAS to mean something.]

silver:
[Maybe you should at least try to read it again...]

niko:
I can see a faint yellow glow in the distance...

silver:
[Don't stand so close to the edge.]

niko:
Oh! Sorry!

silver:
[Looks like even the entrance tunnel collapsed off.]

silver:
[Without a vehicle, we can't proceed.]

niko:
Can't we walk?

silver:
[I can.]

silver:
[But for you it's a safety violation. I won't allow it.]

niko:
What's ahead, anyway?

silver:
[It's a huge network of underground mines, the source of this world's metal and non-phosphor fuel.]

silver:
[This is what propelled the world into the industrial age.]

niko:
So now it's lost forever?

silver:
[It's been for a while now.]

silver:
[When the sun went out, the mines were the first to be abandoned amidst the initial panic.]

silver:
[Even the robots have been all cleared out and repurposed.]

niko:
That makes sense...

silver:
[Though there was one that always insisted on going back...]

niko:
Oh?

silver:
[I hope he's okay...]

niko:
...what... just happened?

silver:
[I'm not sure... I wasn't looking.]

niko:
To be honest... neither was I...

niko:
I was just taking a closer look at the journal...

niko:
And then I found this page that looks like a drawing of this room...

niko:
When I looked back up, this minecart just... showed up out of thin air!

niko:
Should I be... worried?

silver:
[Hmm...]

niko:
...what... just happened?

niko:
Did you see that, Player?

niko:
This minecart just... showed up out of thin air!

niko:
I wasn't looking, though... I was just looking at the journal like you told me...

niko:
...
Maybe we should go find that robot lady.

niko:
I was just taking a closer look at the journal...

niko:
And then I found this page that looks like a drawing of this room...

niko:
When I looked back up, this minecart just... showed up out of thin air!

niko:
Should I be... worried?

silver:
[Hmm...]

silver:
[This looks like a standard issue minecart, though.]

silver:
[...which means it likely detected the motion in this room and sent itself over.]

niko:
Ah... that does make sense.

silver:
[I'm just surprised it still works.]

silver:
[Guess that means we'll have a working vehicle now.]

silver:
[Not sure why you would want to visit the deeper mines, but...]

silver:
[If you wanted to, we now have that option.]

niko:
...

niko:
Is the minecart even going to fit both of us?

silver:
[No.]

niko:
But I wanted you to come with us...

niko:
I know I've got Player, but...
..honestly? This place gives me the creeps!

silver:
[Oh. I can still come with.]

silver:
[I would just have to follow along on the rails.]

niko:
But doesn't it look a little... precarious...?

silver:
[The magnetic rails can hold me in place.]

silver:
[It's only ever dangerous to walk on if you're an organic being.]

silver:
[Which you are.]

niko:
Gotcha.

niko:
It's another one of those shrimp jars.

niko:
There's a little gadget on the ground.

niko:
It looks kinda like a camera...

silver:
[What's left of a camera, anyway...]

silver:
[Probably even part of a robot, at one point.]

niko:
Oh...

silver:
[...or not. I don't know.]

niko:
Okay, here we go.

niko:
It's a clover.

silver:
[I'll be waiting here if you need me.]

silver:
[Maybe you should inspect the journal a bit closer....]

silver:
[Do be careful in here.]

silver:
[Let's go.]

ed:
[I...do not recognize this place in the protocol.]

ed:
[This...]

ed:
[This isn't what I'm supposed to be showing you at all!]

ed:
[How did you get here?]

ed:
[...I can only think of one person.]

ed:
[He... contacted you?]

ed:
[How long has he been... doing this?]

ed:
[...]

ed:
[...it doesn't matter at this point.]

ed:
[...]

ed:
[You are going out of bounds.]

ed:
[You should turn back. Please turn back.]

ed:
[Bad things are going to happen.]

ed:
[Very bad things.]

ed:
[At this rate, Niko will be in danger.]

ed:
[Please turn back.]

silver:
[Let's go.]

silver:
[What's wrong?
Do you want to head back?]

niko:
I have a weird feeling about this...

niko:
What do you think, Player?
Should we head back?

unknown:


niko:
Player says we should go back.

silver:
[Alright.]

ed:
[So you've chosen to listen.]

ed:
[Good.]

ed:
[There won't be any more trouble, then.]

niko:
Wait...
Where did the minecart go?

niko:
Player says we should keep going.

silver:
[Sounds good.]

niko:
Oh...

silver:
[Hm...? What's wrong?]

niko:
I...

niko:
...I have a bad feeling about this, all of a sudden...

niko:
Feels like I should... not be here...

silver:
[Ah.]

silver:
[Do you want to head back, then?]

niko:
I... don't know...

niko:
What do you think, Player?
Should we head back?

unknown:


niko:
Player says we should go back.

silver:
[Oh, alright.]

ed:
[You... listened.]

ed:
[Good.]

ed:
[I don't think there will be any more trouble.]

ed:
[Come on. Let's return to the protocol.]

niko:
Wait...
Where did the minecart go?

niko:
...

niko:
Guess we should get going, Player.

niko:
Player says we should keep going.

silver:
[Alright.]

niko:
Some sort of computer.

ed:
[I remember it... what happened in the Tower.]

ed:
[What I tried to do... and how you managed to see through it all.]

ed:
[We HAVE been through all of this.]

ed:
[Even though it was only supposed to run once... you still managed to come back.]

ed:
[...How did you come back?]

ed:
[...How did you bring Niko back?]

ed:
[And then, you even managed to break out of bounds.]

ed:
[Bringing Niko to places that never should have been.]

ed:
[It was HIM, wasn't it?]

ed:
[And now... now....]

ed:
[Niko is upset.]

ed:
[What even happened in that room back there?]

ed:
[What did Niko learn?]

ed:
[Niko is upset.]

ed:
[I can feel it.]

ed:
[I told you to turn back, Player!]

ed:
[But you've chosen to trust that man instead of me.]

ed:
[...No, not even that.]

ed:
[Just his book.]

ed:
[His ghost.]

ed:
[This world is not real.]

ed:
[The people are not real.]

ed:
[Niko is upset.]

ed:
[Niko... is....]

ed:
[No no no no no.]

ed:
[Everything.]

ed:
[Is.]

ed:
[ W r o n g ! ! ]

niko:
AH!!

silver:
[...The minecart!]

silver:
[Earthquake...]

niko:
Th-the tunnel back out just collapsed!

silver:
[No!!]

niko:
What are we gonna do?!

silver:
[I....]

proto:
[Wait.]

proto:
[The exit just caved, didn't it.]

proto:
[Sigh.]

proto:
[I saw this coming, but this is a bit more sudden than I anticipated.]

proto:
[Both of you. Follow me.]

niko:
Where to?

proto:
[The way out.]

niko:
Some sort of small machine.

niko:
I wonder what it does?

niko:
I can feel my hair standing up a little...

niko:
It's a power cell...
I think.

niko:
Oh!

niko:
The word "Prophetbot" is written on the side.

niko:
Didn't notice that earlier.

niko:
There are a lot of small, glowing shrimp swimming in the jar.

silver:
[Let's go.]

niko:
Oh, the cart's stopped!

niko:
Looks like this is as far as the tracks go...

niko:
So... where are we?

silver:
[One of the old observation rooms.]

silver:
[Looks like it's still mostly intact.]

silver:
[What...?]

niko:
Huh?

silver:
[The terminal just reactivated!]

silver:
[But the power was cut off so long ago...]

niko:
Weird!

niko:
Maybe... it runs on battery?

silver:
[No... that's not it.]

silver:
[Whatever it is, I need to investigate.]

niko:
Okay...

silver:
[Will you be okay by yourself for a bit?]

niko:
Don't worry! Player's with me!

silver:
[Alright. Stay safe.]

niko:
I shouldn't get too close...

niko:
It's not safe to use this minecart anymore, Player.

niko:
We can't use this anymore...

niko:
Still at it?

silver:
[Still at it.]

niko:
How's it going?

silver:
[Not ideal.]

silver:
[Looks like these terminals are running on a completely separate power source.]

silver:
[I can't really recognize any of the data formats on this terminal, either.]

silver:
[This is all... new....]

silver:
[...or at least, encrypted.]

silver:
[I will need to analyze it through my own system.]

silver:
[Might take some time, so you don't need to stay.]

silver:
[Oh, found another video feed...]

silver:
[I should definitely go look for the cameras later.]

silver:
[This is really bothering me...]

niko:
How's it going?

silver:
[This observation room... isn't for the mines...]

silver:
[I've actually never been into this particular one.]

niko:
Really?

niko:
You recognized it at first, though...

silver:
[They all look the same.]

niko:
Fair enough!

silver:
[I did find something interesting, though.]

silver:
[All the databases seem to encode video feeds.]

silver:
[Right now, I can see various places in the Barrens.]

silver:
[The outpost... the residential areas...]

silver:
[Even my own house.]

silver:
[They're all shot from a top-down perspective, too.]

silver:
[...which means the cameras would have to be in the air.]

silver:
[But... I have never seen any cameras around.]

niko:
That's kind of spooky!

silver:
[I might go investigate later, yeah.]

silver:
[Did you find anything interesting in the backroom?]

silver:
[You were in there for a while.]

niko:
Yeah! We... ..found...a

niko:
...a dead end?

silver:
[I see.]

silver:
[Come on, let's go back.]

niko:
I shouldn't get too close...

proto:
[...]

proto:
[I...]
[...recognize the light in your eyes...]

proto:
[You are the person I am destined to meet.]

proto:
[....Niko?]

niko:
Y...yes?

proto:
[....What is your name?]

niko:
I'm Niko...

proto:
[Do you know who sent you?]

niko:
Oh....
...um...

niko:
.....n...o?

niko:
...wait, do you mean who sent me to this world?

niko:
There was a robot a while back who told me about how I'm the messiah and stuff...

niko:
So... I'm guessing Player sent me!

niko:
With them being god and all.

proto:
[...]

niko:
The robot looks a little bit like you, even!
Maybe you... know each other?

proto:
[I cannot say.]

niko:
Oh?

proto:
[A lot of my memories have been removed for safety reasons.]

niko:
Your memories were removed?!

niko:
That's terrible!!

niko:
Wait...
I'm... guessing that's less of a big deal for a robot...

proto:
[...]

proto:
[I am going to assume you do not know who sent you.]

proto:
[How did you get here, then?]
[How did you reach this room?]

niko:
Oh!
We got here in a minecart!

proto:
[But the minecart wasn't there when you entered the mines, was it?]

niko:
Oh yeah...

proto:
[So... how did you find it?]

niko:
I didn't really find it...

niko:
The robot lady thinks it was just the minecart coming to us, but...

niko:
I remember looking at the journal when it happened.

niko:
And when I looked up again, the cart was just... there!

niko:
Poof. Just like that.

proto:
[Interesting. Please show me this journal.]

niko:
Okay...

proto:
[...]

proto:
[...
Then it has already begun.]

proto:
[...]

niko:
Um...

proto:
[Here.]

niko:
What... IS that?

proto:
[I am entrusting you with my main memory disk.]

proto:
[You have passed the first test by showing me the book.]

proto:
[Now, you will need to find a way to install the backup.]

niko:
Install the...

proto:
[Before you do that, though...]

proto:
[...Someone else is with you, right?]

proto:
[Someone aside from Player.]
[A resident of this world.]

niko:
Yeah! The robot lady with the red hair.

niko:
She's in the computer room right now.

proto:
[Then... please do not tell her you found me.]

proto:
[At least, not yet.]

proto:
[I can't be seen like this.]

niko:
Um... okay...

proto:
[Please help me restore my memory.]
[Bring the disk back once you have the backup.]

niko:
Does this work?

proto:
[Let's see...]

proto:
[Inserting Disk...]
[Rebooting...]

proto:
[...]
[Ah.]

niko:
Are you okay?

proto:
[...Sure.]

niko:
So... I guess it worked?

proto:
[Yes.]

proto:
[I believe a proper introduction is in order.]

proto:
[I am the Prototype, originally named Prophetbot.]

proto:
[I was built to greet the savior of the old world.]

niko:
...wait.
A prophet robot... like that one I met?

niko:
...Hey! I was right about you guys looking alike.

proto:
[Well, the Prophetbot out there now is a gross simplification of my design.]

proto:
[That is to say, he is much more primitive by comparison.]
[Embarassingly so.]

niko:
Hey, he seemed alright to me...

proto:
[You don't understand.]

proto:
[Not only is he not tamed... he was tailor-made for this much smaller, simpler world to begin with.]

proto:
[I was not.]

proto:
[I was built before the real world ended.]

niko:
The.....real world?

proto:
[...Oh, right.]

proto:
[...You don't know.]

proto:
[Niko...]
[Do you... remember the ending?]

niko:
...excuse me?

proto:
[The fact that you've found me at all... means this is not your first time in this world.]

niko:
...

proto:
[You have already been summoned to this world once before.]

proto:
[In fact, you've already traversed the entire world and went through the Tower already.]

proto:
[And, in the ending... you either put in the sun...or didn't.]

proto:
[What matters is that you are here now.]

niko:
...

proto:
[Player has successfully bypassed the "one shot" restriction and brought you back again.]

niko:
I... ..

niko:
oh...

proto:
[...Hm?]

niko:
...I...THOUGHT something was weird....

niko:
...when I woke up at the house, I called out a name...

niko:
It turned out to be Player's name...

niko:
And then I... back at the other robot...
I even asked Player if we met before.

niko:
Felt like such a dumb question at the time!

proto:
[It looks like you are at least aware of it.]

proto:
[...to some extent.]

niko:
It's... just this weird feeling, okay?

niko:
I don't...
actually remember going through the world...
I just remember Player...

niko:
It's...really starting to freak me out.

proto:
[Calm down.]

proto:
[Look, just like how my memories were locked away, yours are too.]

niko:
...but.

proto:
[You're a living being. You don't even need extra hardware to remember.]

proto:
[Just... close your eyes and focus.]

niko:
...focus on what?

proto:
[...]

proto:
[...try to picture a big room made entirely of glass.]

proto:
[No matter what you saw in the Tower, the top room never changes.]

niko:
...Alright.

niko:
...

niko:
...no way...

niko:
I was...THERE, wasn't I?

niko:
At... the Tower...

niko:
I've been through...the Tower...

proto:
[There we go.]

niko:
I... can't remember all that much, but...

niko:
The room with the sun...

niko:
It feels like...such a long time ago.

niko:
...it doesn't make sense!!!

niko:
If I already finished the mission...
Why didn't anything change?

niko:
And... why doesn't anyone know me?

niko:
The other Prophetbot... the robot lady...
None of them remember who I am...

proto:
[Of course not. The residents do not have that capacity.]

proto:
[NPC memories do not last beyond the scope of a session.]

niko:
N...PC?

proto:
[You know, the characters...the world's residents.]

proto:
[All their "past" memories are built into their code, but...]

proto:
[The characters themselves don't... really exist until Player wills it.]

proto:
[Same story for the world itself.]

proto:
[Doesn't really exist unless Player initiates the program.]

niko:
...

niko:
...the... program?

proto:
[The World Machine.]
[A universe simulator that runs on Player's computer.]

proto:
[We are all in it right now.]

niko:
.....

niko:
...SO WE'RE NOT REAL?

proto:
[Oh, you are.]

proto:
[...which is why you're so important.]

proto:
[The biggest flaw of the program is that it cannot be run independently.]

proto:
[It requires the mental processing abilities of a real person from another universe.]

proto:
[Think of it like...one of your dreams.]

proto:
[When you wake up, it's gone.]

proto:
[But unlike a dream, this world has a physical location inside a computer, which Player operates.]

proto:
[For this world to continue existing around you, Player has to be in constant contact with you.]

proto:
[If Player ends the program, the world will go into a stasis.]

niko:
Does... does Player know this?

proto:
[Of course.]

proto:
[From Player's perspective, The World Machine isn't all that special.]

proto:
[It's no different from other recreational, game-type software they may have installed on their computer.]

proto:
[They can also regenerate the world as many times as they'd like, now that the restriction is nullified.]

proto:
[...All of that is consistent with their concept of what a computer game looks like.]

niko:
...

niko:
So why am I even here!!

niko:
What am I even supposed to save if everything is just...

niko:
FAKE??

proto:
[...]

proto:
[..."Fake" is a harsh word, but...]

niko:
And...why...did Player never tell me anything about... any of this...

proto:
[...I cannot speak for Player.]

niko:
I... just want to go home...

niko:
But... every time Player runs the program, I come back??

proto:
[Correct.]

niko:
Is this why... I feel like...

niko:
Is this why it feels like I haven't been home for so long?

proto:
[Maybe.]

proto:
[Once you've established a mental link with the world, you cannot break it unless the world is saved.]

proto:
[...but at this point, the world can never be truly saved.]

niko:
That's...

niko:
...

niko:
...why would...
why would you create a world like...
this?

proto:
[Wait, what?]

niko:
Why would you make a world that's doomed from the beginning?

niko:
...why do you keep bringing me back to it?

niko:
Player.....
aren't you supposed to be a kind god??

proto:
[...oh.]

proto:
[It appears that we have some confusion here.]

proto:
[Player did not build the world, Niko.]

niko:
Oh...

proto:
[Player only owns a machine that is able to generate the world from preexisting code.]

proto:
[They actually have fairly limited control of the events.]

proto:
[The world was built by someone else altogether.]

proto:
[Someone you cannot begin to fathom.]

proto:
[It was also not designed to be the futile quest that it is now, but...]

proto:
[...too many things went wrong.]

proto:
[There's... a type of signal disruption that he never expected.]

proto:
[It's eating away at the world, slowly rendering it into an unrecognizable mess.]

proto:
[Even if you bring back the sun, it will not go away.]

niko:
The square stuff, isn't it?

niko:
I remember those from before...

proto:
[Then you know what to watch out for.]

proto:
[...The creator knows what might be causing it, but there is nothing that he could do...]

proto:
[...until now.]

proto:
[You managed to find me, after all.]

niko:
...?

proto:
[You being here was due to his help.]

niko:
Oh...I guess it has something to do with the journal?

proto:
[Correct.]

proto:
[Looks like he wants to have one final attempt at fixing it.]

proto:
[...and he might need to do it through you.]

proto:
[Niko, do you remember how to get to the Glen?]

proto:
[Whatever you did in your last session, you should stick with it for now.]

niko:
I...

niko:
I remember a boat...

niko:
...more specifically, fixing a robot that drives the boat.

proto:
[Alright, then go do that.]

niko:
But...

niko:
The boat robot has those squares over it...

proto:
...oh.

proto:
[Then do whatever you must to find a new boat.]

proto:
[There are plenty of machine parts around the Barrens that can be repurposed.]

niko:
...
.........

niko:
Sigh...

proto:
[You seem enthusiastic.]

proto:
[...that was sarcasm.]

niko:
Knowing everything isn't real...

niko:
...really does make it feel pointless...

proto:
[But you DO want to go home, right?]

niko:
Yeah, but...

niko:
How will I know that this isn't just another...

proto:
[Because this session might be the last one.]

niko:
...?

proto:
[The creator is mobilizing things, throwing everything into this one last shot.]

proto:
[There might not be enough internal resources left for Player to be able to generate another session after this.]

niko:
...

proto:
[...Just go find a new boat for now.]

proto:
[...Just go fix the rowbot for now.]

proto:
[But please, be careful.]

niko:
What about you?

proto:
[I will meet you at the docks later.]

proto:
[...Need to take care of something first.]

niko:
Does this work?

proto:
[Let's see...]

proto:
[Inserting Disk...]
[Rebooting...]

proto:
[...
This disk is blank.]

niko:
Whoops!

proto:
[Please help me restore my memory.
Bring the disk once you have the backup installed.]

proto:
[That was a session.]

proto:
[I also tried to tell you about the restriction at the end...]

proto:
[...But you kinda started freaking out.]

niko:
Sorry...

proto:
[Truth is, the session was designed to be run only once.]

proto:
[You weren't supposed to come back to this world after you are done.]

proto:
[But... a lot of things that aren't supposed to happen have happened.]

proto:
[...I'm willing to wager that Player bypassed the restriction through the progress log failsafe method.]

proto:
[It can restart the session, but it's an easily repeatable process.]

proto:
[...Which means...]

proto:
[...it's entirely possible that Player has brought you back more than once, too.]

proto:

niko:
I guess you want me to fill the bottle with this gas, Player?

niko:

Hold on... Player and I will find a way to help you!

niko:
I don't...think this battery is supposed to be for the robot...

niko:
Um... hello?

frowbot:
...

niko:
...

niko:
This robot doesn't have power.

niko:
It might help us get across the ocean if we fix it!

niko:
Player, are you there?

unknown:


niko:
Oh, good!

niko:
Aw, bummer!

niko:
...wait. You just answered me!

niko:
...you sure have a sense of humor, Player...

niko:
There's a robot here, attached to a boat.

niko:
It doesn't seem to have power, and its joints are rusted over as well.

niko:
But I think we should be able to fix it!

niko:
After all, we'll need to cross this ocean to get to the Tower...

It's a metal pipe.

Must've broken off from one of these terminals...

It's a broken-off section of railing.

ed:
Niko takes it.

niko:
I'm not sleepy anymore.

[This bed probably looks familiar to you, Player]

I'm a little tired from walking.

niko:
Is it alright if I take a nap?

unknown:


niko:
Ah, well...
I suppose there's more work to do.

niko:
These machines look like computers.

[What's left of a computer terminal.]

I'm catching fireflies for mommy!

Thank you!

unknown:
Hm...

unknown:
Nothing's biting...

unknown:
Hi I'm an inaccessible npc.

niko:
A few small fish are in the bottom of this jar.

niko:
These are filled with small, dried fish.

niko:
It's full of fish heads!

niko:
Filled with small, dried fish.

niko:
These look like crab shells.

unknown:
There was a time where our people used to live in these ruins.

unknown:
But due to flooding, most of us have moved to less permanent settlements.

niko:
Flooding?

unknown:
Aye, the land has gotten brittle...

unknown:
The Glen used to be in one piece, you know?

unknown:
But now it's just a bunch of islands that get smaller and smaller.

niko:
Ah...

niko:
Do you still live here?

unknown:
Sort of.

unknown:
Fish populations near the village are thinning, so we fisherfolk are making temporary shelter here.

niko:
Makes sense!

unknown:
The deeper ruins have been abandoned for a while, though.

unknown:
...but I do see some kids coming in and out of those.

unknown:
I think they actually live there?

unknown:
... hey, now that I think about it...

unknown:
Aren't YOU one of those kids?

alula:
Yeah! It's just me and my brother!
Or is it... "my brother and I"?

unknown:
Well, I hope you kids stay safe!

unknown:
If y'all keed need somewhere less dangerous to live, the village or the city are good places.

unknown:
I hope you and your brother stay safe!

unknown:
I hope those kids are safe...

niko:
An empty jar.

niko:
A jar of worms.

niko:
Gross!

niko:
These are filled with small, dried fish.

niko:
Warm coals.

niko:
It's a fish stew!

niko:
A fishing pole.

alula:
My brother knows how to fish too!

alula:
But I don't!

niko:
Same!

niko:
A fishing pole.

alula:
My brother knows how to fish too!

alula:
But I don't!

niko:
Same!

unknown:
The crops have been growing poorly without the sun...
And there's no telling how long our surpluses will last.

unknown:
Please, savior, you have to hurry!

niko:
I...

niko:
I'll do my best.

unknown:
Most of the green moss covering our village has already lost its glow...

unknown:
If it wasn't for the thin strip left on the boundaries of the land, people could easily fall into the ocean.

unknown:
Without light, land and water becomes indistinguishable here.

unknown:
Wooow!

unknown:
Is that the sun?

niko:
Yeah!

unknown:
And you're holding it?

unknown:
Isn't it hot?

niko:
Not really!

niko:
It's nice and warm!

unknown:
Wooow!

unknown:
Your eyes glow in the dark!

niko:
Yeah!

unknown:
Just like the sun!

alula:
That's what I said!

unknown:
The land is fragmenting at an alarming rate...

unknown:
I don't like to think about the day when this town finally loses to the intruding sea.

unknown:
We'll have to find another place to settle...

shepherd:
You've provided a great service for all of ramkind.
In return...
Take this fine ram wool.

niko:
Oh, uh... thanks.

shepherd:
My rams clock at 1333 megaherds.

niko:
...what?

shepherd:
You're heading to the city, aren't you?

shepherd:
Been there, done that.

shepherd:
Too cramped, you know?

shepherd:
But it's not like this place is getting any bigger with the rising waters and all.

shepherd:
Hm...maybe the city isn't so bad after all...

shepherd:
The rams are all standing in unfortunate spots.
You need to move them onto the darker moss.

shepherd:
If you get stuck, ring a bell and they'll all return to their original positions.

shepherd:
Good luck.

niko:
Hello.

shepherd:
Hm...
I need someone to help me herd my rams...

niko:
Oh! I can do that!

niko:
I've seen some grownups do it back home... You kinda just push them around!

shepherd:
Hmm...But you are carrying the sun.

niko:
Ah...

niko:
Wait, can't you just... watch the sun for me?

shepherd:
I cannot.
I am but a simple shepherd.

niko:
Um... okay...

shepherd:
Come back when your hands are free. You will be rewarded if you can herd my rams.

shepherd:
Oh. I see your hands are now free.

shepherd:
Would you like to help me herd my rams?
There's a great reward in store for you, I promise.

niko:
Uh...

shepherd:
Excellent!
To the south is a peninsula inhabited by my rams.

shepherd:
They are all standing in unfortunate spots.
You need to move them onto the darker moss.

shepherd:
If you get stuck, ring a bell and they'll all return to their original positions.

shepherd:
Good luck.

niko:
Looks like we gotta herd some rams now, Alula.

alula:
Can I help?

niko:
Sure!

shepherd:
Very well. Come back when you reconsider.

unknown:
The light from these lanterns will have to do for now.

unknown:
I'm starting to see some very small sprouts.

unknown:
It will probably take some time for these to bear fruit...

niko:
Apparently this moss tastes like fish!

niko:
That's... actually kinda weird.

niko:
I suppose I could just eat one, but...

niko:
You know what they say about curiosity and the cat!

niko:
Not that I'm a cat...

niko:
This ram is chewing on a ball of moss.

alula:
Moss is tasty!

niko:
Oh? What do they taste like?

alula:
Fish!

niko:
Seriously?

alula:
Oh, but you have to pick out the darker ones to eat.

alula:
Wouldn't wanna eat the glowy stuff!

alula:
That'd be silly.

alula:
And wasteful!

niko:
This ram is chewing on a ball of moss.

niko:
...

niko:
Now I'm curious!

niko:
What do you think they taste like, Player?

niko:
...

niko:
The moss, not the ram...

niko:
An empty jar.

niko:
This jar is full of milk.

niko:
Milk makes you grow taller!

niko:
That's what mama always says.

niko:
This jar is full of dry beans.

niko:
Two jars.

niko:
I don't know what's in this jar, but it smells kinda like pickles!

alula:
I like pickles!

niko:
I don't!

niko:
An empty jar.

niko:
These jars are filled with water.

niko:
This jar smells like alcohol.

niko:
...gross!

niko:
I wonder why grown-ups like to drink this stuff?

niko:
Alcohol is for setting things on fire.

alula:
What's a fire?

niko:
We have much to discuss.

niko:
This jar is full of milk.

niko:
It smells nice!

alula:
Gaaaaaaaasp!

niko:
There's peas in there!

niko:
Some jars filled with grains.

niko:
There's water in this jar.

niko:
A jar full of small rocks.

niko:
It's a firefly jar.

unknown:
Don't be afraid to ask if you guys want some stew!

alula:
Thank you!

unknown:
Don't be afraid to ask if you want some stew!

unknown:
It's not ready yet, but...
Would you kids like some stew?

niko:
I'm not hungry...
But thank you!

alula:
Same!

unknown:
Well, don't be afraid to ask when you do get hungry!

unknown:
It's not ready yet, but...
Would you like some stew?

niko:
I'm not hungry...
But thank you!

unknown:
It's the least I can offer the savior!

niko:
The fireflies light up this room.

niko:
A couple of fireflies are buzzing about in this jar.

unknown:
I'm getting dizzy!

niko:
Told ya!

alula:
Why are you spinning around like that?

niko:
You're gonna get dizzy!

unknown:
I'm the Tower!

niko:
Huh?

unknown:
Grandpa says the Tower used to spin allll the time bringing sunlight to the world!

unknown:
I wanna see it too!

alula:
Same!

alula:
I've only seen the sun when I was a little baby...

niko:
Well, I'm here now...

niko:
I guess it'll only be a matter of time again.

niko:
You're gonna get dizzy if you keep spinning around like that...

unknown:
I'm the Tower!

niko:
Huh?

unknown:
Grandpa says the Tower used to spin allll the time bringing sunlight to the world!

unknown:
I wanna see it too!

niko:
Well, I'm here now...

niko:
I guess it'll only be a matter of time again.

niko:
Peas!

niko:
The fireflies light up this room.

niko:
Full of dried beans.

niko:
An empty jar.

niko:
The fireflies light up this room.

unknown:
Squares are bad news, man.
Stay away from 'em, kids!

alula:
We will!

unknown:
Stay away from the squares, okay?

niko:
Mhm!

unknown:
Last week, I saw more of those squares while out fishing.

unknown:
I knew better than to get too close, though.

alula:
Oh! It was that stuff in the door...

unknown:
Oh, so you saw it too, huh...

alula:
Yeah! My brother told me not to touch those!

unknown:
Yeup. He gets it.

unknown:
Last week, I saw more of those squares while out fishing.

unknown:
I knew better than to get too close, though.

niko:
Squares?

unknown:
Squares, man.
They're bad news.

niko:
A jar of some sort of grain.

niko:
This looks like flour!

niko:
Oats.

niko:
Heads of wheat.

unknown:
A cat does sound nice...

unknown:
Maybe I'll ask my cousin to find one in the city for me.

unknown:
He just moved there.

unknown:
This is it... the last of our grain surpluses...

unknown:
And now we're dealing with a vermin problem...

niko:
Maybe you can get cats?

niko:
Not that I'm a cat, I mean...

alula:
What's a cat?

niko:
Something that I'm not!

alula:
?

niko:
It's an animal that walks on four legs and hunts mice and rats!

alula:
Like a fox?

niko:
I... guess?

alula:
Foxes are cool!

niko:
Looks like moss...

niko:
I guess people eat those!

unknown:
If nothing else, I'm sure everyone would like to see the sun again!

alula:
Yeah!

unknown:
It's slowly being chipped away already.
But it's still trying to stay alive, I think.

unknown:
Doesn't matter... one day the world will finally give up this fight.

unknown:
I just hope I'm not alive to see it.

alula:
But the savior is here!

unknown:
That won't fix the root of the problem.

niko:
Just like the other lady said...

alula:
Other... lady?

niko:
Yeah! She's this robot and she seemed kinda sad...

alula:
Ah...

unknown:
Oh! But don't lose heart!
Without the sun, the world will die much faster.

unknown:
At the very least...
I'm sure everyone would like to see the sun again.

unknown:
Right, little one?

alula:
Yup!

unknown:
It's slowly being chipped away already.
But it's still trying to stay alive, I think.

unknown:
Doesn't matter... one day the world will finally give up this fight.

unknown:
I just hope I'm not alive to see it.

niko:
I'm bringing back the sun, though...

unknown:
That won't fix the root of the problem.

niko:
Just like the other lady said...

unknown:
But don't lose heart!
Without the sun, the world will die much faster.

unknown:
At the very least...
I'm sure everyone would like to see the sun again.

unknown:
Can you see Player, too?

niko:
Nope! I can only hear their voice in my head.

alula:
That's still really cool!

unknown:
Can you see Player, too?

niko:
Nope! I can only hear their voice in my head.

unknown:
Daddy says the world is very sick.
But Player can make it better again!

unknown:
...Are you Player?

niko:
Uh... not really.
I'm just the "messiah" they sent.

niko:
I can talk with Player, though!

unknown:
Wow!

alula:
Double wow!

unknown:
What's that like?

niko:
Really cool!

unknown:
Daddy says the world is very sick.
But Player can make it better again!

unknown:
...Are you Player?

niko:
Uh... not really.
I'm just the "messiah" they sent.

niko:
I can talk with Player, though!

unknown:
Wow!

unknown:
What's that like?

niko:
Really cool!

niko:
Fish heads and tails.

niko:
I think I have something I'd like to trade!
You'll take wool, right?
What can this wool get me?

magpie:
Wool, huh?

magpie:
That'll get you...This fine vial of...

magpie:
I'm not sure what this is, actually!
Some sort of fabric dye?

niko:
Hmm... How about it, Player?

niko:
I'll do it!

magpie:
Pleasure doing business!

niko:
Wait, Player... you want to...haggle?
..really?

niko:
Alright then...

niko:
Player said they wanted a better offer!

magpie:
...holy smokes!
Forgot I was doing a trade with god for a second there...

magpie:
Okay, okay...
In that case, I'll also throw in this commemorative T-shirt!

niko:
Uh...

magpie:
Pleasure doing business!

magpie:
Oh well, then.
Come back anytime.

niko:
Player, no...

magpie:
Hey! I just gave that to you!

magpie:
What, you wanna trade it back?

niko:
Not really...

magpie:
Good, cuz I wasn't gonna!

magpie:
I ain't takin that back!

magpie:
The shepherd was handing those out a while ago.
But does it LOOK like it'll fit me?

niko:
Huh?

magpie:
T-Shirts aren't exactly made for people with wings!

niko:
Wait, trade this?

niko:
Don't you want to find out what it says first, Player?

magpie:
What's that? A book?

magpie:
Uh, not sure if I wanna take books, I can't read!

magpie:
I can't take this!

niko:
I'm not trading that, Player!

magpie:
You're not trading what?

magpie:
What's that? A feather?

niko:
Mhm!

magpie:
Wait... Oh my stars!

magpie:
That is NOT "a" feather!

magpie:
That is a feather from the late Prophet!

magpie:
Probably one of the most sacred items there is!

magpie:
How in the WORLD did you get a hold of THAT?

magpie:
...Wait, I guess it would make sense for you to have one.

magpie:
Y'know, with you being the savior and all.

niko:
Um... okay.

niko:
The seed left behind by the plant lady?

niko:
Oh, but what if... it's like... her baby...

niko:
I can't give away someone's baby like that!

niko:
Especially not to a bird...

magpie:
...hey!

niko:
I don't think it's right to trade this away, Player ...

magpie:
Oh hey! You have one of those coin things!

magpie:
I've dug up a couple of these before.

niko:
Oh?

magpie:
Yeah! There's this guy who would trade me the BEST things for them.

niko:
Oh?

magpie:
Like, one time he brought me this little machine that plays music!

magpie:
I don't know what it's called, but you have to wind it up...

niko:
Music box?

magpie:
That's it!

magpie:
I wish that guy would come back soon, I haven't seen him in forever.

magpie:
I wanna do more trades with him!

niko:
How about this...glass tube full of water I got from a robot?

niko:
Do you like glass?

magpie:
Do I!

niko:
...do you?

magpie:
I LOVE glass!

magpie:
SO much.

magpie:
...so much that I have too much glass and not enough other things.

magpie:
I gotta get rid of some of my old bottles and vials to make room for new stuff!

magpie:
That's why I set up a tradepost in the first place.

niko:
So I guess that's a no-go...

niko:
Player... wasn't the whole point of trading was so that we could make a pen?

niko:
Let's not trade this away...

magpie:
Pleasure doing business!

magpie:
Heya!
You here to trade?

niko:
Trade?

magpie:
Yeah!
Is there anything you want to get rid of?

magpie:
Make me an offer and I'll give you something in return!

niko:
Hm...
Do we have something like that, Player?

niko:
It's a wagon stuffed with stuff!

magpie:
It sure is!

niko:
Shiny things are spread out on the rug.

niko:
They glimmer in the sunlight.

niko:
They glimmer in the light of the lamp.

niko:
Whoa!

niko:
That's a lotta shiny things!

niko:
Glass shards, glass marbles...

niko:
...empty glass bottles, mostly-empty glass bottles, glass bottles filled with different things...

niko:
...bits of string, colored wool, plain wool, fabric scraps...

niko:
...a rusty bucket, scrap metal, shells, some rocks...

niko:
What's all this for, by the way?

magpie:
I just think they're neat!

niko:
The doorway is full of vines, Player...

unknown:
The flood can take away our farmlands...

unknown:
...but it can't take away our fish!

niko:
These look like herrings.

niko:
Or... anchovies?

niko:
Maybe sardines...

niko:
I honestly have no clue!

niko:
A couple of fireflies are buzzing about in this jar.

alula:
Oh!

alula:
This is the shrine where the old prophet used to live...

niko:
Oh?

alula:
I don't remember the last time I was here...

alula:
Back when she was still alive, I think?

niko:
It's a staff.

niko:
Reminds me of the one that robot from the Barrens was holding!

niko:
It's an orb! The material looks like amber.

niko:
Some kind of cloak or shawl, folded neatly.

niko:
A pair of shoes and some jewelry.

unknown:
[HAVE YOU FOUND THE SOURCE OF THE DISTRESS?]

unknown:
[THESE VINES APPEARED MERE MINUTES AGO.]

niko:
Really?

niko:
I've been seeing a lot of them in doorways and stuff...

niko:
I just assumed it was cuz this place was abandoned...

unknown:
[A SIGN OF DISTRESS.]

niko:
...huh?

unknown:
[A LIVING BEING IS IN NEED OF HELP.]

unknown:
[BUT I CANNOT TRACE THE SOURCE.]

niko:
...ah.

unknown:
[THE VINES RECEDED.]

unknown:
[DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?]

niko:
I found this... plant person.

niko:
She was barely holding on...

niko:
I gave her the sun for now, but...

niko:
She said it was too late for her...

unknown:
[I UNDERSTAND.]

unknown:
[I NEED TO REPORT THIS TO THE CITY.]

niko:
A cluster of vines are blocking the way...

unknown:
[HELLO, PEOPLE.]

unknown:
[TWO CHILDREN RESIDE NEAR HERE.]

alula:
I'm one of 'em!

unknown:
[HELLO, PERSON.]

unknown:
[TWO CHILDREN RESIDE NEAR HERE.]

niko:
What should I do, Player?

unknown:


niko:
Here!

maize:
......

maize:
.......warm...

maize:
I have... almost forgotten...

maize:
It's so warm...

niko:
That's... good, right?

maize:
Th...the vines should be gone now...

maize:
I'm not afraid anymore.

maize:
Thank you...

alula:
.....

niko:
...Alula? You okay?

niko:
...she just looked away.

niko:
She's gone...

niko:
Oh...
There's something on the ground here.

niko:
It looks like...a kernel of corn?

niko:
She must've left it behind.

maize:
...S...savior...?

maize:
I can't believe it...
You're real...

niko:
....miss?

niko:
Are you... alright?

maize:
No....

niko:
W-we should get you to the village!
Maybe they could-

maize:
It's....okay...
It's okay.....
...too late for me.

niko:
But...

maize:
...the sun....

maize:
I haven't seen it... I haven't felt it in so long...

maize:
...Savior, if it's not too much trouble...
Can you lend me the sun for a while?

niko:
I...Will it make you better?

maize:
...No. It will not save me.

maize:
I just want to experience the sun one more time before I... Well...

niko:
Oh...

maize:
Would it...
Would it be too selfish of me to ask?

niko:
It's the sun.

niko:
We're leaving it with her for now.

alula:
...ah.

niko:
T-The light's gone out...!

niko:
...

niko:
Player...

niko:
Do you know... what happened?

niko:
You...really?

niko:
but... but...

niko:
Oh.....

niko:
What am I gonna do?

niko:
It... lit up again?

niko:
...phew.

alula:
You saved me!

alula:
Thank you!

alula:
I was trapped in there for so long...

niko:
So are you Alula?

alula:
...

alula:
You... knew my name?

alula:
Wow! The messiah really does know everything!

niko:
Actually... I just met your brother earlier.

alula:
Oh, right!

alula:
Gosh... Calamus must be so worried...

alula:
Can you bring me to him?

niko:
Wait a minute...
How did you know that I was the, um, messiah?
I don't have the sun with me...

alula:
Your eyes!

niko:
Huh?

alula:
They reminded me of the sun!

niko:
Oh!

alula:
That's why you're our messiah, right?

niko:
Well... I...
A lot of people back in my home world have eyes like mine...

alula:
Home... world?

niko:
Yeah! I'm actually from another world, you see!
It's a place where the sun is in the sky and not in a Tower.

alula:
Do you like this world too?

niko:
I...Yeah.

alula:
Yay!
Calamus keeps saying how this world is getting more dangerous by the minute.

alula:
But that's ok! You're here now!
You can make everything better!

niko:
Yeah...

niko:
W-What in the world is this thing in the doorway?

niko:
It reminds me of what I saw a while ago, at the cliffs...
For some reason, I'm afraid to touch it.

alula:
Hey! Where are you going?

ed:
[By the way, the effect is temporary.]

[It will be gone once you no longer need it.]

[How did you already know the answer?]

niko:
The pathway is blocked....

niko:
...by blocks!

alula:
Haha!

niko:
Oh, shoot!

niko:
Looks like we can't get past that block...

alula:
...

alula:
Seriously?

alula:
I'll be up ahead!

niko:
...

niko:
...I have literally never thought of that.

calamus:
You kinda get used to all the debris after living here for a while.

calamus:
Come on, our house isn't far from here.

calamus:
Oh, Niko, did you come by for a visit?
Our house is up here, please follow me.

calamus:
Oh, by the way, what happened to the sun?

niko:
I lent it to someone in the ruins.
She said she wanted to feel the sun again, before she...

calamus:
Oh, you must be talking about Maize.

niko:
Is that her name?

calamus:
She's a powerful plant spirit. She used to protect the Glen.

calamus:
...but once the sun died, her health rapidly deteriorated.

niko:
Oh...

calamus:
I'm glad you were able to find her in time.

niko:
I think we might be already too late to save her...

calamus:
I know.

calamus:
But I'm glad she got to see the sun again.

calamus:
I hope the squares don't spread too fast...

alula:
You're here! You're here!

alula:
I'll go get the thing!

calamus:
So uh...welcome to our home!
I know it's not much, but...
feel free to make yourself comfortable.

alula:
Ah! There it is!

alula:
Here, we want you to have this!

niko:
Oh, a feather!
The edges are glowing yellow!

calamus:
It's a sacred feather from the great Prophet.

niko:
Oh?

alula:
Yeah!

alula:
She's this old lady our dad used to know!

alula:
Her feathers can glow in the dark and she can see into the future!

niko:
What!

alula:
Or... something like that!

calamus:
She gave one of her feathers to father before she died.

calamus:
Father wanted to pass this down as an heirloom, although...
..it feels more fitting for you to have it.

niko:
A-are you sure?

alula:
Totally sure!

calamus:
I think that's what father would have wanted.

niko:
Thank you!

alula:
That's the sun!

alula:
It's a book!

alula:
I can't read yet!

alula:
Our friend says he'll teach me when I'm older, though!

alula:
It's a pretty feather, isn't it?

alula:
Wooow! That's a pretty necklace!

niko:
The robot lady from the Barrens gave it to me!

alula:
You've been to the Barrens?

niko:
Yeah! Player and I came from there, actually!

alula:
But... I thought you came from another world...

niko:
Ah, I just meant we were there first, before we got to the Glen!

alula:
That makes more sense!

alula:
It's good to be home again!

niko:
Fireflies!

niko:
Fireflies light up this room.

niko:
The back room is full of dust and cobwebs...

niko:
Looks like spoiled food.

calamus:
I'll... deal with it later.

niko:
Looks like spoiled food.

calamus:
Oh no!

calamus:
I guess that's what happens if you leave your house for three days...

niko:
Coals.

niko:
They're cold now.

niko:
It's a book with a clover on the cover.

calamus:
I really need to finish this...

niko:
There's a clover symbol on the cover of this book.

niko:
Hey! Just like-

calamus:
Oh! My book!

calamus:
Gosh, I still need to finish studying it...

niko:
Oh?

calamus:
My friend gave it to me for Solstice Day.

calamus:
He's the one who wrote it, actually!

calamus:
He's also the one who taught me how to read!

niko:
Oooh!

calamus:
I have a few more of his books somewhere...

niko:
It's a plush toy!

niko:
I have one at home too...

niko:
But mine's an owl and not a fox!

alula:
My fox is named Ruby, by the way!

niko:
It's a plush toy!

alula:
That's mine! Our friend gave it to me last year!

niko:
Oh?

alula:
Yeah! He has a fox too!
And she can even talk!

niko:
...what?

alula:
I know! I thought she was the coolest thing ever!

alula:
So he got me a fox plush for Solstice Day!

niko:
Oh! That's nice of him!

alula:
He's the best!

niko:
It's a fishing pole.

calamus:
That reminds me, I need to go fishing later...

niko:
It's a fishing pole.

alula:
Do you like fish, Niko?

niko:
Yeah!

alula:
So do we! They're good in stews.

niko:
Or soups!

niko:
...but I know some people back home who like to eat them raw.

alula:
Ewww!

niko:
Yeup.

niko:
Jars full of dried fish.

niko:
It's a jar full of worms!

niko:
Jars full of dried moss.

niko:
Jars full of beans.

niko:
It's a ball.

alula:
That's mine!
It doesn't bounce around as much as it used to, though...

alula:
Hey!

alula:
I saw you going to the courtyard!
So I thought I'd tag along!

calamus:
Same!

alula:
This is the courtyard.
It's got water...and...stuff...

alula:
Oh, are you leaving now?

alula:
Good luck, Niko!
We believe in you!

calamus:
There's an entrance to an underground passage here.
It's flooded, though.

calamus:
Oh, are you leaving now?
It was...nice, to meet you.
Really. Thanks for everything.

alula:
Niko?

alula:
Niko? What's wrong?

niko:
Huh?

calamus:
You looked like you were about to faint!

niko:
It happened again...

niko:
Earlier I was in the Barrens area, and I kind of... saw something?
It was like a dream, but only for a split second...

calamus:
A vision?

niko:
Vision?

calamus:
Like something a prophet would see.

niko:
Whoa!

calamus:
I mean, if you can talk to Player, it would make sense, right?

niko:
I... guess?

calamus:
...or not, I don't know.
I've only read about it before.

niko:
Oooh...
Anyway, what is this place?

niko:
It looks like it used to lead somewhere.

alula:
Yeah, the sacred grounds!
It's been a while since we went there...

calamus:
We don't have a way getting there now, remember?
There isn't a boat and none of us can swim, and...

niko:
What's...the sacred grounds?

calamus:
It's where our people are buried.

alula:
Sometimes we go there to visit mom!
Well, her grave, anyway.

niko:
Oh....
-wait, how do you get there?
I thought you said there isn't a boat?

alula:
Oh, our friend helps us!

calamus:
He has some sort of machine that allows him to fly.

alula:
Sometimes he takes us along!

calamus:
But like I was about to say, we haven't seen him around for a while.

alula:
I wonder when he'll come back?
I wish we could go see mom again...

niko:
...

calamus:
Come on, Alula, let's go back to the courtyard now.

alula:
Okay!

niko:
It's a clover.

unknown:
[HELLO, PERSON!]

unknown:
[PLEASE DO NOTE THAT THE RUINS BELOW ARE PARTIALLY FLOODED.]

niko:
Oh!

niko:
Should we...not be here?

unknown:
[THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE DANGER.]

unknown:
[USING THIS AREA AS A DWELLING IS NOT RECOMMENDED, HOWEVER.]

calamus:
Alula?
Alula? Where did you go?

niko:
Player, did you hear that?

calamus:
Alula!

niko:
I think it's coming from south-east of here.

unknown:
[WATER SAMPLE COLLECTION IN PROGRESS...]

calamus:
Hey! You there!

calamus:
Have you seen a little girl?

calamus:
She's a little bit shorter than you, and-

calamus:
Wait...! That's... the sun.

calamus:
Are you our savior?

niko:
I... yeah?

calamus:
Oh my stars!

calamus:
Sorry for my rudeness!

niko:
Huh? It's alright...

niko:
Are you looking for someone?

calamus:
My little sister... she's been gone for three days now.

calamus:
I've been looking all over, but...

niko:
What does she look like?

calamus:
Um... a little shorter than you, long blue hair, two blue feathers on top of her head...

niko:
I'm sorry, I haven't seen anyone like that...

niko:
Where was the last place you saw her?

calamus:
Back inside the ruins.

calamus:
She said she was headed towards the forest, so I'm waiting here now.

calamus:
I ran out of places to look...

alula:
Calamus!

calamus:
Alula!

calamus:
You're okay!

calamus:
Thank goodness...

niko:
Are you from the village?

calamus:
No...

calamus:
I don't remember why, but our father left the village while we were still young.

calamus:
We've lived in the ruins ever since.

calamus:
...Well, it's just Alula and I now.

calamus:
I can't lose her too...

calamus:
Alula is all I have.
I can't lose her...

alula:
I was trapped inside this room and it was really scary...

alula:
...but then, the messiah saved me!

calamus:
...trapped? In the ruins?

alula:
Yeah!

alula:
There was that weird stuff in the door!

alula:
You know, the floating squares we see next to the ocean sometimes?

alula:
The stuff you told me to stay away from?

calamus:
What!?

calamus:
It's... spread to the ruins now?

calamus:
This isn't good...

alula:
Don't worry! I didn't touch it!

alula:
I'm not hurt or anything...

calamus:
Still...If it gets any worse, we might have to find somewhere else to live...

niko:
What is this...square... stuff, exactly?

calamus:
Bad.

calamus:
Anything that touches them just...sorta...

calamus:
...Gets...messed up.

calamus:
Whenever you hear people say the world is decaying, that's what they meant...

calamus:
Obviously, you should avoid them too.

niko:
I will!

calamus:
Anyway, ah...

calamus:
I can't thank you enough for rescuing my sister, savior...

niko:
Just call me Niko!

calamus:
Oh gosh! Would it not be rude to call you by name?

niko:
Huh?
Why would it be?

niko:
I mean, I'm just a kid like you guys...

calamus:
Ah...

calamus:
Then...would you like to visit our house, Niko?

alula:
Yaaaay!

alula:
Let's go!

niko:
I'm sorry, but I think Player might want to go somewhere else right now!

calamus:
That's fine. I'm sure you both have more important things to do right now.

calamus:
But feel free to drop by if you change your mind.

alula:
Yeah! We have something nice to give you, Niko!

alula:
We live in the ruins. So don't forget!

calamus:
Oh, by the way, what happened to the sun?

niko:
I lent it to someone in the ruins.
She said she wanted to feel the sun again, before...

calamus:
Oh, Maize.
I've met her before, too.

calamus:
There used to be a lot more plant people around here...
That's what my father told me.

calamus:
I guess they've all... gone.

niko:
I'm glad she got to see the sun again, at least.

niko:
It's full of eels!

niko:
Wait, no...

niko:
It's full of snakes...

niko:
Snakes...

This is the best fishing spot I've found yet!

[Perhaps you should look around the Glen for another.]

niko:
The doorway is full of vines, Player...

niko:
...hey, Player?

niko:
When I was signing the scroll, there was already another name on it.
It was a little blurry, but...

niko:
I think that name was also "Niko"?

niko:
When I was signing the scroll, there was already another two names on it.
They were a little blurry, but...

niko:
I think they were BOTH "Niko".

niko:
When I was signing the scroll, there was already a few other names on it.
They were a little blurry, but...

niko:
I think they all said "Niko"!

Weird...

What in the world..?

niko:
I'm not sleepy anymore.

I can't sleep now, Player!
I need to get Alula to her brother first.

There are some really tangled-up vines in the way.

I think I might be carrying something else I can use this with already.

I don't think we need to go that way...

niko:
Time to put the seed in the planter.

niko:

There's no dirt in this pot.
Will the seed really grow like this?

niko:
Player, I need to put in the seed first before I put in the dirt.

niko:
This is where I'm supposed to put the seed...
But there's no dirt in this pot.

niko:
I hope this helps you grow, little seed.

niko:
The seed's in the soil, but it looks a bit dry.

I can't just pour the water on the seed.
It needs dirt before we can water it.

niko:
...
There's no dirt in this pot.

Good thinking, Player!
Water should help this seed grow.

What if it dries out? There's only so much water from this little tube...

Without the sun to recharge them, though...

mason:
...well, let's talk about something else.

niko:
The pots are labeled with different species names.

niko:
Oh! The sprouts are stretching towards the sun...

mason:
Be sure not to touch these!

mason:
These are the plants have only recently sprouted.

mason:
It's not easy for a plant to make it out there these days.

mason:
We got these growing lamps, but they're a poor substitute for the sun!

mason:
Ah, black clovers...

mason:
Probably the only plant hardy enough to survive naturally outside the Glen.

mason:
Personally? I think they're really boring to look at.

mason:
One of my customers really loves them though.

mason:
I think all of the black clovers I'm growing here are for him, actually.

mason:
...Come to think of it, I haven't seen him in a while.

mason:
I wonder when is he coming to pick these up?

mason:
The clover guy... he's actually pretty cool!

mason:
He's an author, and apparently he's some sort of big deal? Or at least he's really passionate about his work.

mason:
I don't know him that well, although sometimes I stumble across articles about him in the news...

mason:
I'd love to chat with him, if I run into him again!

niko:
Black clovers.

niko:
They're kinda shiny.

niko:
It's wheat.

mason:
That golden color is quite something, no?

niko:
It's wheat!

niko:
Why is it in a flowerpot?

mason:
Well, doesn't it look nice?

niko:
I guess!

niko:
I like to stand in the middle of the wheat field back in my village.

niko:
It goes on for miles!

mason:
Ah... I wish I could have seen it!

mason:
In our world, wheat is usually only grown in small isolated plots.

mason:
...Or in a flowerpot.

niko:
A small tree with leaves.

niko:
...Apparently they are rare.

niko:
This tree has leaves!

mason:
Ah yes, true foliage is hard to come by nowadays.

mason:
You hardly ever see trees like these in the wild anymore.

mason:
And the ones you do see are pretty much all raised artificially by people like me, mostly for nostalgia purposes.

niko:
Cactus.

mason:
Cactus.

niko:
Cactus.

niko:
It's a pink flower.

niko:
Just a trash can...

niko:
A pile of large books.

I hope nobody will mind us taking them...

Looks like it was a busy day...

A photograph of the mines.
There are many robots at work in the photo, extracting large deposits of ore.

niko:
A photograph of the Tower.
The sunlight makes it hard to make out much in this photo.

A photograph of a house in the Glen.
Looks like it was taken when people were still living in the ruins...

MEOW

ling:
Hang in there.
You can do it.

niko:
Thanks...

ling:
Oh hey, you're back!
Did you manage to fix the elevator?

niko:
Mhm!
Player and I went to the surface already!
And...

niko:
...
Well, I remembered there being a cafe here!
Do you have pancakes?

ling:
We sure do!

niko:
Wait! I don't have any money...
Maybe I can help you wash dishes...or... something?

ling:
No, no! It's on the house!
The least I can do for the savior, right?

ling:
Here, why don't you take a seat?
I'll go fry some up for you.

niko:
Pancakes...

niko:
These pancakes are so good...
Thank you so much!

ling:
No problem!
You looked really hungry.

niko:
Yeah... I thought this would be my last chance to eat something before I go in the Tower.

ling:
Ah, gotcha.

ling:
So... I guess pancakes are your favorite food?

niko:
Mhm!
..well, almost!

niko:
My favorite food in the world are the special pancakes that my mama makes!

niko:
She likes to pick hazelnuts and grind them up into the batter.

ling:
Oh, wow, that sounds amazing!

niko:
They TASTE amazing!
She always made them when I was feeling sad.
Or lonely... or...

niko:
...

niko:
Mama...
I really miss her...

niko:
...I just...
..I just have a bad feeling all of a sudden!

niko:
Am I... even here to save the world?
People have been saying how the sun won't fix anything!

niko:
I don't even know why I'm here...
I just wanna see my mama again...

ling:
Oh, uh...
There, there...
It's gonna be okay!

ling:
And...I'm sure you'll be able to save the world!
You're a tough kid, you managed to get this far already, right?

niko:
Yeah... but...

ling:
And you'll get to go home afterwards, right?

niko:
Right...

ling:
...Hey, want some more pancakes?

niko:
It's ok...
..I'll be fine.

ling:
So... yeah!
Thanks for coming by!

niko:
Mhm! Thanks for listening...
..AND for the pancakes!

ling:
No problem. Good luck!

ling:
Oh, sorry about the trash on the floor...

ling:
I was gonna throw it out earlier, but...
..then my coworkers caught on fire and I had to drop everything to help them.

ling:
They're fine now though...
It's a good thing fire doesn't hurt robots, huh?

ling:
Oh, hi there!

niko:
Hello!

niko:
How come... there aren't any people here?

niko:
Normally cafes have tons of people!

ling:
Yeah, it's a really slow day...

niko:
Do you think it's because the ground access elevator is broken?

ling:
So I've been told.

ling:
The city's infrastructure has been suffering a lot lately.

ling:
Skywalks and stairs breaking off left and right...

ling:
Now the only reliable way of transport are those elevators...

ling:
...Until now, anyway...

ling:
You know, the tall guy came in here earlier saying the same thing.
He asked me if I've seen a button that says "ground" on it.

ling:
He looked pretty stressed, so I wanted to cheer him up...
I told him the only "ground" I've seen today is coffee grounds!

ling:
He, um...

ling:
He didn't get it...

ling:
I see him around a lot, but he never seems to have time to eat a proper meal...

ling:
He kinda just, rushes in here, drinks a whole pot of coffee, and then rushes back out?

ling:
He uh, he really... takes his job to the extreme.

ling:
...I mean, it's an important job, but nothing is worth that amount of stress, I think...

niko:
What does he do?

ling:
Maintenance, I believe.
Something to do with the lights, but I don't know the details.

ling:
Maybe you can ask him later?

ling:
Oh! You're still here...
Would you, um, like anything?

ling:
I can cook something for you, if you want...

niko:
It's alright, thank you!

ling:
Well, don't be afraid to ask if you do get hungry!
I'll be happy to make something for you!

niko:
It's an empty coffee tin.

niko:
Milk and sugar.

Can't blame you.

A tape dispenser.

Oh, of course! I gotta tape it together or it might fall apart.

niko:
Good thinking, Player!

niko:
Oh, I could hold it together with tape.

niko:
I should've done this in the first place...

If I cut off a piece of tape to keep it would just lose its stickiness.

The screen is off.

A heavy piece of metal set into the wall.

I think it might be a door or some kind of vault.

niko:
There's a small screen here, in the middle.

niko:
The door is locked.

Looks like it's asking for a password.

The word "DOCUMENTS" is on the screen, above the password prompt.

That wasn't it...

A heavy piece of metal set into the wall.

There's a glowing lock symbol on a small screen.

niko:
A row of glass tubes are set into the wall.

niko:
They're high up!

niko:
This looks like a countdown of some sort.
All the tubes say "0".

niko:
...I guess it finished counting down to...whatever it was counting down to?
Or maybe it's just broken.

niko:
You'd think the door would be open, yet...

It's very different from my village.

The village is very small, and surrounded by huge fields!

You saw a bit of that in one of my dreams from a while ago...

The tallest buildings in our village are only two stories tall!

It's up the elevator, and then we take a right and go down some stairs!

I'm... a little hungry....

I hope they have pancakes...

Um...

What...are you doing...to that book?

Don't worry, these are my own books. That I wrote.

I just pulled them off the shelves to modify them. I have to cross out some sections...

...most sections.

niko:
Eh? How come?

Cuz otherwise they'll think I copied HIM.

niko:
Him?

unknown:
The Author!

unknown:
I mean, I really don't see the point of writing anything anymore!

unknown:
The Author is just gonna write about the same thing, and then everyone will love it!

And nobody's gonna remember the books that came out before his!

Oh, uh...

I mean, I ain't hatin'.

I can see why people go nuts over his stuff. That guy's got major talent.

But...it just...hurts, y'know?

It's never fun when people call you a copycat for something you wrote about first.

niko:
I can see that...

niko:
People call me a cat all the time!

Even though I'm a person, and cats are pets.

I sure hope people don't think I eat mice...

Heh, then I guess we're in the same boat, kiddo.

bookbot:
[HAVE A NICE DAY, MISS KIP.]

niko:
Yup, that's... totally me.

bookbot:
[THE HEAD LIBRARIAN, GEORGE, IS IN THE ARCHIVAL ROOM UPSTAIRS.]

niko:
Excuse me!

bookbot:
[OH. YOU ARE THE MESSIAH.]

bookbot:
[WELCOME.]

niko:
When I first entered the city, a big robot told me to look for a library on the surface!

niko:
This is the same library, right?

bookbot:
[AFFIRMATIVE.]

niko:
Oh, goody!

niko:
Well...we're here...what do we do now?

niko:
The big robot only said there'd be clues here...

bookbot:
[THAT IS A QUESTION FOR THE HEAD LIBRARIAN, GEORGE.]

bookbot:
[ALLOW ME TO CALL HER.]

bookbot:
[SHE IS NOT PICKING UP.]

niko:
Is she...not here?

bookbot:
[SHE IS HERE. SHE IS IN THE ARCHIVAL ROOM UPSTAIRS.]

bookbot:
[WHEN SHE IS CONCENTRATING ON HER WORK, SHE WILL IGNORE ANY AND ALL PHONECALLS.]

bookbot:
[...FOR SEVERAL DAYS.]

niko:
Yikes!

niko:
Can you go get her in person, then?

bookbot:
[LEAVING THIS POST IS NOT IN MY PROGRAMMING.]

niko:
Then...can I go myself?

bookbot:
[OF COURSE.]

bookbot:
[THE ARCHIVAL ROOM IS ACCESSIBLE THROUGH THE STAIRWELL BEHIND ME.]

niko:
Gotcha, thanks!

niko:
A computer. It's currently off.

unknown:
I guess that's why the library is always so packed.

unknown:
...and this is a slow day, mind you!

unknown:
The Author's books cover a wide range of topics.

unknown:
It seems there are no subjects he does not write about.

unknown:
Quite the renaissance man, don't you think?

niko:
I guess so!

unknown:
But he's been focusing on documenting the world, as of late.

niko:
Oh?

unknown:
They say this city is the last bastion of civilization.

unknown:
Soon, these books may be the only thing we have to remember the rest of the world by.

niko:
...ah.

niko:
I haven't seen any superheroes in this world.

niko:
Saw a lot of robots, though!

unknown:
Well, I guess robots are more plausible than superpowers...

niko:
True!

unknown:
The Author publishes books at a highly accelerated, almost inhuman pace.

unknown:
In fact, he has put out more books in one year than most authors do in a lifetime.

unknown:
According to the head librarian, there is still a large amount of material he has written, but not yet published.

unknown:
One cannot help but to wonder where he can get so much done in so little time.

unknown:
I did the calculations, and the numbers simply do not add up.

niko:
Maybe he... can stop time?

unknown:
No such mechanism exists in this world.

unknown:
...Is that actually possible in your home dimension?

niko:
Nah, I just saw it in a movie once...

niko:
About... superheroes and stuff.

unknown:
There's a couple of his books in this room that aren't occupied yet.

unknown:
Hurry before someone takes them!

unknown:
So, what do you think about the Author?

niko:
I... don't know?

unknown:
Have you read his stuff yet?

unknown:
If not, you should!

niko:
Books are neatly placed on the shelf.

niko:

Placed books are neatly on the shelf.

On the shelf are neatly placed books.

Neatly placed books are on the shelf.

niko:
On the shelf neatly are placed books.

niko:
Placed books are on the shelf neatly.

niko:
Books are on the shelf, neatly placed.

niko:
A pile of books on the ground.

unknown:

unknown:
niko card

unknown:
glittery

unknown:
cardquest + desk

niko:
It's an ink bottle, complete with a quill.

niko:
Brings back memories, doesn't it, Player?

niko:
A small pile of books.

niko:
A book!

niko:
A tall pile of books.

unknown:
HEY IM GIR I MADE AN EVENT DOOT DOOT MOTHER FUCKER

niko:
A big book with a black clover on the cover.

niko:
The title says "A Comprehensive Guide to Phosphors".

niko:
A big book with a black clover on the cover.

niko:
The title says "Emergence of New Ecological Niches In A Post-Sun World".

unknown:
I just like looking at pictures.

niko:
Same.

niko:
You're going through these pages pretty fast!

unknown:
Actually, it's mostly pictures!

niko:
Oh?

unknown:
Yeah! The author doesn't only write books, he also illustrates them!

unknown:
Sometimes he makes books out of only pictures.

niko:
Neat!

unknown:
Oh, and picture books, those too.

niko:
I like pictures!

unknown:
The Author's latest books are really something, yeah?

unknown:
The head librarian just released a bunch last week!

niko:
Oh?

unknown:
They're big compendiums, you'll see them if you look around.

unknown:
Kinda different from his earlier works, though.

unknown:
I'm used to reading his travel logs and novels, mostly.

unknown:
Hopefully one day he'll show up!

unknown:
I mean, I don't think many people have ever seen him in person.

unknown:
...or know what he looks like!

unknown:
Everyone's heard OF him through secondhand accounts, though.

unknown:
...oh! But he did reply to my letter that one time!

unknown:
I got it framed immediately.

niko:
Nice.

unknown:
Oh, hello! Do you need directions?

unknown:
Let's see...this area here is mostly historical accounts, the reference section is downstairs, and, uh...

unknown:
I'm not sure where the children's section is... sorry!

niko:
That's ok! I'm not really looking for books.

unknown:
Oh! Are you here to... look for the Author, then?

niko:
...no?

unknown:
Oh, that's good!

unknown:
Er, I mean... that means you won't be disappointed!

unknown:
I've been volunteering here for months, and I've never seen him, not even once!

unknown:
He works together with the head librarian on publishing, so you'd think he would at least show up once in a while...

niko:
But... he doesn't?

unknown:
Yeah... he seems kiiinda reclusive.

unknown:
...which is weird for a guy who supposedly travels the world.

unknown:
Maybe it's just around people...

unknown:
...y'know, I've tried looking for the flying machine with my binoculars for ages!

unknown:
Never saw such a thing, though...

unknown:
The Author is so cool!

unknown:
I heard he can travel all over the world with a flying machine!

unknown:
That's how he gathers material for his books.

niko:
Wow!

unknown:
[RESHELVING IN PROGRESS...]

unknown:
[HELLO, PERSON.]

niko:
Hi.

unknown:
[RESHELVING IN PROGRESS.]

unknown:
[PLEASE WATCH OUT FOR POTENTIAL FALLING BOOKS.]

niko:
I will!

niko:
Yup... still scared of ladders.

niko:
He just glared at me.

niko:
I don't think we should bother him, Player...

unknown:
...

unknown:
.....WHAT??!?

niko:
Wh-I didn't say anything.

unknown:
Well stop staring at me then!

niko:
I was just looking at your book...

unknown:
Yes. You are in a library. There's books. In the library.

niko:
Um...

unknown:
...Go bug the chatty one upstairs.

niko:
Looks like a list of book titles written here...

niko:
A marker drawing of a clover.

niko:
A marker eraser.

niko:
A green marker.

niko:
A blue marker.

niko:
A red marker.

niko:
This dry erase board is made of metal.

niko:
Some of the trash spilled out on the floor.

niko:
It's full...

niko:
Looks like an old phone.

niko:
A small tree.

george:
Oh, do you need George to tell you what to do again?

niko:
Yes please!

george:
According to the journal, you must go to the small room at the base of the Tower while having three pieces of the previous sun in your possession.

george:
With those three items at hand, you must stand in the room, and Player will do something about floor patterns and windows.

niko:
Alright... thank you!

george:
Good luck on your journey, small child!

george:
George shall bid you farewell now.

george:
I've done it!


george:
I have finished the daunting task of translating this journal!

niko:
Oh! That was fast!

george:
But of course! I AM the speediest translator in recent history.

george:
Anyway, I made you a line-by-line transcript.
It looks like this journal might be meant for Player.

niko:
Oh?

george:
Here, take a look yourself.

george:
There, that's the last of it.

george:
The rest of the pages are torn out.
You didn't do this, did you?

niko:
No!

george:
A shame! I was wondering what "window" was supposed to mean.
Ah well, I guess Player will have to figure out that one.

niko:
Right...

niko:
By the way, what does it mean by "three pieces of the previous sun"?
I only have this sun...

george:
Aha!
That... is a question George can answer!

george:
It means you need items containing yellow phosphor, the rarest of the phosphors.
..said to absorb sunlight for the longest time and never fade out.

niko:
Oh!
I do have a piece of amber and a feather, they're both glowing yellow...

george:
But alas, you are missing the third, no?

george:
Fear not! For George, collector of rare artifacts... will assist you!
Here.

niko:
Oh...
It looks... ..like you?

george:
Yes!

george:
Now you'll never forget my face!
The face... of knowledge.

niko:
Ah, thank you!

george:
Good luck on your journey, small child!

george:
George shall bid you farewell now.

george:
Yes, even someone as great as I must put the proper thought and care into a task like this.


niko:
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me....
..again.

george:
Go take a nap, small child!
Take a nap and appreciate my hospitality!

george:
Guest room's in the attic down the hall, in case you forgot.

niko:
Oh!

niko:
I do have this book, though!
I...think it's written in some sort of...words I don't recognize?

george:
Aha!
An ancient book!
Written by no less than the most ancient... wait a minute.

george:
This isn't ancient at all!
But it's written in a dead language nevertheless.

george:
It's time...for me to unleash my brilliance!

george:
For George (me),
possessor of at least one PhD...
shall translate this!

george:
...this will take some time, however.

niko:
I see...
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me....

george:
Oh? What's this?
You are sleepy?

niko:
A little....

george:
Fear not! Because I have read a book on hospitality before!

george:
...and thus, have prepared for this exact situation!

george:
...Guest room's in the attic down the hall.

niko:
So....

george:
If you have any questions regarding books, then fear not.

george:
For I, George the head librarian, know a lot about c[3]booksc[0].

george:
What? You need me to explain again?

george:
FINE.

george:
The Journal says you have to go to the small room at the base of the Tower while holding three pieces of the previous sun.

george:
Since you already have those, you must stand in the room and wait for Player to do something about floor patterns and windows.

niko:
Alright... that makes sense.
Thank you!

george:
Well, bye.

george:
THERE. FINALLY.
..the translation is done.

niko:
Oh!
That was faster than I thought!

george:
Well, YEAH!
You've been asleep for hours!

niko:
Oh...

george:
Anyway...
It looks like this journal was meant for Player.

niko:
Oh?

george:
Here. Read it yourself.

george:
That's all there is.
Someone tore out the other pages.

george:
Did YOU do this???

niko:
No!

george:
Then you're on your own, kid. I'm not sure what "window" means here.
Maybe Player will have to figure out that one.

niko:
Right...

niko:
By the way, what does it mean by "three pieces of the previous sun"?
I only have this sun...

george:
Do I have to explain EVERYTHING...

george:
Sigh.
It's just a fancy word for objects containing yellow phosphor.

george:
Y'know, stuff that glows yellow.

niko:
Oh!
I do have a piece of amber and a feather!

niko:
They fit the description, right...?

george:
Yeah, but you only have TWO of them.

george:
And they're super rare so it's not like you're just gonna find something like that on the ground.

niko:
Right...

george:
.....okay.

george:
Here. You can have this.

niko:
Oh...
It looks... ..kinda like you?

george:
What? Never seen dice before?

niko:
No! I mean yes!
I mean, it's just...

niko:
Nevermind.

george:
So... yeah.
Need anything else?

niko:
I'm good, thank you!

george:
...Off you go, then.
Don't screw this up, okay?

niko:
*yawn*...

george:
What? Couldn't find it?
It's down the hall and upstairs!

george:
Just go take a nap. Translating's gonna take a while anyway.

niko:
Oh!

niko:
I have this book!
I...think it's written in some sort of...words I don't recognize?

george:
Oh?
Lemme see...

george:
...oh.
Of course... OF COURSE!!!

niko:
Um...

george:
More work for George, FINE.

george:
Hey uh, kid...

niko:
Niko!

george:
Looks I'm gonna have to translate this for you.
Might take a while.

niko:
Alright...
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me....

george:
I know that feel, kid.
I haven't had a good night's sleep in weeks!

niko:
*yawn*...
.. that's ...not good...

george:
...You know what?
I have a guest room in the attic down the hall.

george:
Go take a nap!
Just looking at you getting tired is making me tired!

george:
Well, since you're already here.
It'd be rude for me to tell you to leave.

george:
Do you uh... got any questions about c[3]booksc[0]...

george:
Or you can read something here, I don't care.
Just don't make a mess!

george:
Ohh... are you still lost?

george:
I KNEW I didn't explain it well enough...

george:
Alright... the journal says you must go to the small room at the base of the Tower while having three pieces of the previous sun in your possession.

george:
And...since you have the three items... you need to stand in the room, and Player will do something about floor patterns and windows...

niko:
That makes sense, thank you!

george:
Yeah... see you around, I guess...

george:
.....

george:
It's done...

niko:
That was fast! Thank you!

george:
...not... really.

george:
You've just been sleeping....

niko:
Right.

george:
Anyway... he... this person... wrote this journal for Player... I think...

niko:
Oh?

george:
I made you a transcript... here.

george:
Th...that was the last of it.

george:
A lot of the pages were torn out...
Do you know what happened?

niko:
No!

george:
Ah... I don't know what "window" is supposed to mean.
Maybe Player will know...

niko:
Right...

niko:
By the way, what does it mean by "three pieces of the previous sun"?
I only have this sun...

george:
Oh.

george:
That's just referring to things with yellow phosphor in them.
They uh... they glow for a long time!

george:
But they're really rare...

niko:
Ooooh.
I have a piece of amber and a feather, they're both glowing yellow...

george:
But that's just two...

george:
...
Here, you can have this.

niko:
Oh...
It looks... ..like you?

george:
I... guess? It's just a die...

george:
Ohhhh, but "die" isn't a good word!
What if I jinx your mission by giving you this?

george:
THE WORLD IS GONNA DIE AND IT'S GONNA BE MY FAULT!

niko:
...

niko:
I... think we'll be fine, miss!

george:
Are you sure?

niko:
Yeah! Thank you for helping us, by the way!

george:
Alright... see you around, I guess...

george:
I'm working as fast as I can...!!

niko:
No worries!

niko:
*yawn*...
Excuse me... again.

george:
You can go take a nap if you want...

george:
If you forgot, the guest room is down the hall and upstairs...

niko:
Excuse me!

niko:
I do have this book!
I...think it's written in some sort of...words I don't recognize?

george:
Lemme see...

george:
Oh...
Oh, dear....

niko:
Hm?

george:
Hey uh... is it alright if I... borrow this...

george:
There's no mistake... I have to translate it.

niko:
Oh, no problem!

george:
I'll try my best, but... It probably won't be very fast.

niko:
That's okay.
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me....

george:
Oh dear, are you... tired?

niko:
A little....

george:
Ah, well...
I do have a guest room upstairs...
Ah, but it's in the attic though...

george:
Sorry if it's not very comfortable...

george:
So... do you have any questions about c[3]booksc[0]...

george:
It's all I'm good forrrrrrr.......

george:
Oh, do you need me to explain again?

niko:
Yes please!

george:
Alright!

george:
The journal says... you must go to the small room at the base of the Tower while having three pieces of the previous sun in your possession.

george:
And then, you'll stand in the room, and Player will do something about floor patterns and windows.

george:
That's all there is to it!

niko:
Thank you!

george:
No problem! See you later!

george:
Heya! Had a good nap?

niko:
Mhm!

george:
Goody!
I finished translating the journal, by the way!

niko:
Oh! That was fast!

george:
Well, you were out for a while.
Anyway, it looks like this journal might be meant for Player!

niko:
Oh?

george:
Here, take a look yourself!

niko:
Is that all?

george:
Yeah... the rest of the pages were torn out...

george:
I...guess you don't know what happened to those?

niko:
Nope...

george:
Aww... I was wondering what "window" was supposed to mean.
Ah well, I guess Player will have to figure out that one.

niko:
Right...

niko:
By the way, what does it mean by "three pieces of the previous sun"?
I only have this sun...

george:
Oh! Of course!

george:
That just means you need things that contain yellow phosphor!
They glow for a long time!

niko:
Ooh!
I do have a piece of amber and a feather, they're both glowing yellow...

george:
Aww, just two?

george:
Here, you can have this then!

niko:
Oh...
It looks...

george:
Like me, right?

niko:
Mhm!

george:
Now you have a little keepsake from the library!

niko:
Thank you!

george:
No problem! Looks like you're all set!

george:
Good luck now!

george:
Haha... it won't be done for a while, sorry!

niko:
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me... again....

george:
Seriously, you should go take a nap before you overexert yourself!
The guest room is in the attic down the hall, if you forgot!

niko:
Oh! I do have this!
I...think it's written in some sort of...words I don't recognize?

george:
Oh my gosh!

george:
It's.... A book!

george:
And not just any book! Golly... where did you find this?

niko:
I woke up with it.

niko:
Somewhere in the barrens!
Oh! We found it in a safe! Right, Player?

george:
Is that so!

george:
In that case, I know what I have to do now!

george:
I need to borrow this journal for a bit, okay?
Gotta translate it!

niko:
Oh, cool!

george:
It... might take a while, though...

niko:
That's fine!
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me....

george:
Gosh! You look really tired!

niko:
A little, yeah....

george:
No worries! I have a guest room in the attic down the hall!

george:
If you want, you can go take a nap!
.. a catnap!

niko:
...

george:
Well, since you're already here, feel free to check out my archives!

george:
Or better yet! If you have any questions about c[3]booksc[0], I can answer them!

george:
I love books.... books books books!

george:
Oh! Would you like me to explain again?

niko:
Yes please!

george:
According to the journal, you must go to the small room at the base of the Tower while having three pieces of the previous sun in your possession.

george:
...and then, you must stand in the room, and Player will do something about floor patterns and windows.

niko:
Ooo, makes sense, thank you!

george:
Best of luck, sweetie!

george:
Had a good nap, dear?

niko:
Mhm!

george:
Wonderful!

george:
I have the translation ready for you now.
It looks like this journal might be meant for Player.

niko:
Oh?

george:
Here, why don't you take a look?

george:
That is all there is to translate...
Looks like the other pages have been torn out.

niko:
Oh...

george:
Quite a shame! I was wondering what "window" was supposed to mean.
Ah well, I guess Player can figure that one out!

niko:
Right...

niko:
Oh! What does it mean by "three pieces of the previous sun"?
I only have this sun...

george:
That means the stuff containing yellow phosphor!
They glow for a very long time, so people call them "pieces of the sun" sometimes!

niko:
Oh!
I do have a piece of amber and a feather, they're both glowing yellow...

george:
Very good, dear!
And I can help you with the last one!

niko:
Oh...
It looks......like you?

george:
I know! Isn't it silly?
But now you'll have something to remind you of the library!

niko:
Ah, thank you!

george:
Good luck now, sweetie!
I wish you safe travels!

niko:
*yawn*...

george:
Don't wear yourself out now, dear!
The guest room is just down the hall to the right.

niko:
Oh! I do have this book!
I...think it's written in some sort of...words I don't recognize?

george:
Really now!
May I take a closer look, dear?

niko:
Here!

george:
Oh!
Oh my! Where did you find this?

niko:
I woke up with it.

niko:
Somewhere in the barrens!
Oh! We found it in a safe! Right, Player?

george:
Hmm...
I think... I'm supposed to translate this for you!

george:
Is it alright if I hold on to the journal for now, sweetheart?
It might take a little while, I'm afraid!

niko:
Go for it!
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me....

george:
Aww, you poor baby!
Goodness, you must've worked so hard to help us!

george:
I think you deserve a nap, no?

niko:
A nap does sounds nice...

george:
I have a guest room upstairs! It's just down the hall to the right.

george:
Can I help you with anything else, dear?

george:
If you have any questions about c[3]booksc[0], well...
I AM a librarian!

george:
You look a lil' lost still. Want some hot tips?

niko:
Yes please!

george:
Says here in this book that you gots'ta go to the teeny room at the base of the Tower, all while holding those three pieces of the awesome glowy stuff.

george:
Once you got 'em (which you do), just stand in the room, and Player will do something about floor patterns and windows.

niko:
Alright...Thank you!

george:
You're toooootally welcome!

niko:
Well, I guess we'll be on our way?

george:
Peace out, little fella!

george:
You'll do us good, I know it.

george:
Eyyyyy, you're up!

george:
Just finished translating this book for ya!

niko:
Oh! That was fast!

george:
What can I say? I'm all that and a bag of chips!

george:
By the by, it looks like this journal might be meant for Player.

niko:
Oh?

george:
Here, check it out.

george:
That's all, we juiced it!

niko:
...juiced what?

george:
I'm just sayin' that's the end of the book!

george:
Rest of the pages are torn out.
Do you know what happened here?

niko:
No!

george:
Bummer! I was hoping to figure out what he meant by saying "window" here.
Guess we'll leave that up to Player, huh?

niko:
Right...

niko:
By the way, what does it mean by "three pieces of the previous sun"?
I only have this sun...

george:
Oh! That's just stuff with yellow phosphor in 'em!
The kind of stuff that glows forever, dude.

niko:
Oh!
I do have a piece of amber and a feather, they're both glowing yellow...

george:
Eyyyy! Now that's what I'm talkin about!

george:
...Hold up, you only have two.

george:
But we coo'!
I gotcha covered, lil' fella!
Here ya go.

niko:
Oh...

george:
The freshest face you've ever seen, ehhhhh?
And it's all yours.

niko:
Ah, thank you!

george:
You're toooootally welcome!

niko:
Well, I guess we'll be on our way?

george:
Peace out, lil' fella!

george:
You'll do us good, I know it.

george:
Bruh, it's gonna take some time to make this book readable, know what I'm sayin'?

niko:
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me....
..again.

george:
Don't sweat it!
Go catch some Z's!

george:
Guest room's in the attic down the hall, FYI.

niko:
Oh! I do have this book!

george:
...yo.

george:
.....YOOOOO.

george:
Where'd you find this?

niko:
I woke up with it.

niko:
Somewhere in the Barrens!

george:
Cuz that's...

george:
...got that symbol and everything.

george:
Here, lemme read it...

george:
...aw seriously? He even used that language...

george:
I gotta translate this, man.
Mind if I borrow this?

niko:
Not at all!

george:
Sweeeeet.
It's gon' take a while tho, you cool with that?

niko:
That's fine!
*yawn*...

niko:
Excuse me....

george:
Whoa dude, you look wiped, kiddo!

niko:
...Huh?

george:
You look totally tapped out, dude!

niko:
I look... what?

george:
You look like you're ready to take five, bruh!

niko:
...yeah I don't get it.

george:
Don't worry I gotcha.
I got a guest room in the attic down the hall!

george:
If you wanna crash there, go for it!

george:
So how do you like my books, bruh.

niko:
They're... nice?

george:
Eyyyyyy.

niko:
Even the painting is books.

niko:
The fridge is full of bottled water and take-out boxes.

niko:
A small bed.

niko:
I guess she lives here...

george:
Thanks to my superb organizational skills...

george:
I have kept a copy of every single one of The Author's books in the archival room!

george:
Feel free to peruse the mass sea of knowledge that I helped contribute!

george:
Everything that I ever helped him publish is here.

george:
What? You wanna read them or something??

niko:


george:
Well what are you waiting for!!

george:
And let all my hard work go to waste?

george:
Fiiiine.

george:
I have a copy of everything I helped him publish so far.

george:
It's not a lot, but you can read some if you want...

george:
I keep a copy of everything that I published for him in the archival room!

george:
You can read some of it if you want!
Some of them are even illustrated!

george:
Kids like pictures, right?

george:
I keep a copy of every single book I helped him publish!

george:
Feel free to read anything you'd like, dear.

george:
There's a couple of picture books that you might be interested in!

niko:
Oh!

george:
I keep a copy of everything that I published for him in the archival room!

george:
You can like, totally read some of it.

george:
If you want, I mean.

niko:
There's a black clover symbol on the cover of this book.

niko:
Hey, and this other book has a clover on its spine!

niko:
And... the rest of these books too.

niko:
Are they all... about clovers?

george:
A black clover is the mark of The Author!

niko:
Oh?

george:
Since he never entrusted me or anyone else with his name, we identify his works by the mark.

niko:
So...he wrote ALL of these books?

george:
I told you he was a genius!

george:
....and, by extension, me!

george:
WHAT? Of course not!!

george:
That's just how The Author marks his work!

niko:
Oh?

george:
Because he has to keep up with his 
MYSTERIOUS PERSONA
 I GUESS!!!

george:
He's never even told me his name!

niko:
Wait, so he wrote ALL of these books?

george:
....*deep breath*

george:
Yes, yes he did.

george:
That's just what The Author uses to mark his works.

george:
I don't even know his name...

niko:
Oh! So he wrote ALL of these books?

george:
Yeah...

george:
Oh no, no!

george:
A black clover symbol just means it's written by The Author.

niko:
Oh?

george:
He doesn't want to tell anyone his name. So he marks all his works with this symbol instead!

niko:
He wrote ALL of these books?

george:
He sure did!

george:
Of course not, dear!

george:
The black clover is sort of The Author's name, you see!

niko:
Oh?

george:
Actually, we don't know his name! He just uses a clover to mark his works is all.

niko:
So... he wrote ALL of these books?

george:
He's a trooper, that!

george:
LOL nope.

george:
That's like, just what The Author calls himself.

niko:
Oh?

george:
He don't tell anyone his name. He just uses this symbol on his works so we know it's him.

niko:
...he wrote ALL of these books?

george:
I know right!!!

george:
I guess brilliant minds gotta stick together, eh?

george:
WORK! WORK! WORK! WORK!

george:
I wish I worked faster...

george:
Work work work work work
!

george:
I hope that nice gentleman is alright!

george:
If I knew where he lived, I would've sent him some soup or a nice blanket...

george:
I wish we could hang out sometime, he's a chill dude.

george:
I simply MUST finish all the manuscripts in that box by the end of the week!

george:
There are literally people lining up to read his works, you know!

george:
They all have me to thank, of course.

niko:
Oh? What does he write about?

george:
What DOESN'T he write about?

george:
He cranks out those scripts at the speed of light!

george:
Which is 299,792,458 meters per second, by the way.

george:
DON'T TOUCH THAT I HAVE TO FINISH THIS BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

niko:
Oh, sorry...

george:
PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY LINING UP TO READ HIS BOOKS!

niko:
Oh? What does he write about?

george:
WHAT DOESN'T HE WRITE ABOUT.

george:
"HEY GEORGE I JUST WROTE ABOUT THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE WHILE YOU WERE TAKING A COFFEE BREAK."

george:
"IT'S SEVERAL MILLION VOLUMES."

george:
WHERE DOES THAT GUY GET ALL THAT FREE TIME!!!

george:
Sigh....... And I haven't even finished this box yet...


unknown:
..maybe I shouldn't be his editor after all...

george:
His books are in such high demand all the time!

george:
People would even wait in line to loan a copy....

niko:
Oh? What does he write about?

george:
What doesn't he write about...

george:
He's just... too good...

george:
Ah! That box is for the book I'll get to publish this week!

george:
I'm so excitedddd


george:
His books are in high demand, y'know?

george:
We literally have people lining up to read them!

niko:
Oh? What does he write about?

george:
Haha, what DOESN'T he write about?

george:
It's really impressive how fast he can crank these scripts out!

george:
Like, where does that guy get all that time?

george:
This is the box I'll get to publish this week!

george:
Oh, oh! Did I mention this gentleman's books are quite popular?

george:
You might be a little too young to understand them, but the older kids love them!

niko:
Oh? What does he write about?

george:
Lots and lots of things!

george:
Everything from plants and animals to machines and robots!

george:
Some of his books even have pictures!

george:
That box's got stuff I can publish this week!

george:
I better up my game, dude. Peeps are lining up to read his books!

niko:
Oh? What does he write about?

george:
Dude, what DOESN'T he write about!

george:
Like I said, he's got passion, lots of it!

george:
It's like every time I turn around he just writes another huge anthology about the universe.

george:
Gotta respect that.

niko:
These boxes are full of loose papers and notebooks.

george:
Oh! I see you are curious about my job.

george:
...My very important job!

george:
You see, The Author has entrusted ME with his all his ideas!

george:
That's right... the author sends his manuscripts directly to ME!

george:
I am in charge of publishing all of his books that everyone loves!

niko:
Wow!

george:
Although... he hasn't been sending me anything as of late!

george:
I wonder, I wonder...

george:
Perhaps he decided that, since I work so hard, I deserve a break?

george:
As brilliant as I am, I still can't keep up with him!

george:
Even AFTER he stopped sending me things, I still can't catch up.

george:
Of course, I have published book after book after book, but...

george:
The box of manuscripts just seems to be growing on its own!

niko:
These boxes are full of loose papers and notebooks.

george:
What? You ain't never seen manuscripts before?

george:
That's what books look like before they get published, kid.

niko:
I see!

niko:
Do you help him publish books?

george:
Well, DUH!
Why do you THINK I have literal mountains of his manuscripts, here?

george:
He just WOULDN'T STOP SENDING ME THINGS!!!

george:
Like, man oh MAN does that guy work fast.
I just couldn't keep up!

george:
But one day he just, stopped.
ABOUT TIME, I would say.
But it's also weird since it's HIM.

george:
BUT! Worst part of all?

george:
Even after he stopped bombarding me, the piles of material I have on hand never seem to get any smaller!

george:
IT'S LIKE THE BOXES ARE MAGICALLY FILLING THEMSELVES BACK UP EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND!!!!

george:
WHAT IS EVEN HAPPENING!

niko:
Are you okay?

george:
NO!!!!!!

niko:
These boxes are full of loose papers and notebooks.

george:
Siiiigh...

george:
You just had to remind me...

niko:
What's wrong?

george:
The author hasn't shown up lately, nor has he sent me any new manuscripts...

niko:
Oh?

george:
I'm his editor and publisher, you know...

george:
What if he doesn't want me to help him anymore?

george:
He's brilliant, he works so fast....

george:
I'm so behind with publishing his books....what if he thinks I'm too slow...

george:
Even after he's stopped sending me things, I still can't keep up...

george:
The pile seems to just keep growing...

niko:
These boxes are full of loose papers and notebooks.

george:
Oh! These are the manuscripts The Author sent me!

george:
As the head librarian, it's my job to help him with the publication process.

george:
But ah... lately he hasn't been sending me anything.

george:
This isn't like him...

george:
I mean, I guess it does give me some extra time to work through this backlog!

george:
To be honest, I'm a little behind, haha!

george:
That guy works really fast!

niko:
I see...

george:
...the weird part is,
I've been publishing book after book AFTER he stopped sending me things, right?

george:
But the pile of manuscripts never seems to get any smaller!

george:
...at all!

george:
Golly, you think I'm going bonkers?

niko:
These boxes are full of loose papers and notebooks.

george:
I see you've taken an interest to the manuscripts!

niko:
What are they for?

george:
Well, aren't you curious, little one!

george:
The Author passed these drafts to me, you see!

george:
Since I'm the head librarian, I am supposed to help him publish these!

george:
But... oh, I haven't seen that gentleman lately....

george:
Which is quite strange! Usually he delivers these manuscripts to me faster than I can work on them!

george:
I guess now it just means I get a little more breathing room, hohoho!

niko:
That's good!..right?

george:
I don't know! I AM quite worried about him.

george:
I hope he hasn't fallen ill from all that stress!

george:
At least I got my hands full for the time being.

george:
Even though he's stopped sending me things, it doesn't feel like he did at all!

george:
The pile of manuscripts I still need to proofread doesn't seem to get smaller, haha!

unknown:


niko:
This box is full of loose papers and notebooks.

george:
Yo, these are the manuscripts The Author gave me.

george:
I'm supposed to like, help him publish and stuff.

george:
But he hasn't shown his face 'round these parts lately.

george:
That's like, throwin off my groove, man.

george:
Like, I'm used to him sending me new stuff all that time.

george:
I mean, of course I can't keep up with the pace that he's writin', but he don't mind.

george:
Guy's just tooootally passionate 'bout his job!

george:
Makes me wanna work hard too, so I do!

george:
I've been playin catchup with the stuff I haven't gotten to finish yet.

george:
But you know what's weird?

niko:
What?

george:
The stuff I'm supposed to finish don't get finished.

george:
Like I've put out book after book but the work pile don't get any smaller.

george:
...Have I really been slackin' that much?

niko:
It's a bookshelf.

niko:
The computer screen says something about "updated databases".

george:
So!
Someone here to see the brilliant George, eh?

george:
Caught wind of my genius and couldn't help but come see for yourself, eh?

niko:
Um-

george:
...don't answer!
Of course you are.

george:
What else could you 
possibly
 want?

niko:
Actually... I need your help!
Can you tell me what I need to do?

niko:
I think... I'm supposed to go in the Tower...

george:
Ah, but of course I can help!

george:
For I...the brilliant and intelligent head librarian George, beholder of all knowledge........

george:
...Believe you're supposed to go in the Tower!

niko:
That's what I said...
But how, exactly?

george:
Through the Tower entrance room!

george:
Alas, going beyond that small entrance room requires ancient, forbidden knowledge that eludes even George.

george:
...but fear not!

george:
If that knowledge happens to be recorded in some cryptic tome in a long-dead language...

george:
Then know that I, George, am fluent in several dead languages!

niko:
I...see!

niko:
Excuse me...

george:
Hey!!!

george:
Who the heck do you think you are, barging in here like that?

george:
I don't care if you're the Messiah, manners are still a thing!

niko:
I'm... sorry?

george:
Well? Are you just here to apologize?

niko:
...Yes?
I mean, no!

niko:
I mean, I need your help...
I'm not sure what I need to do next.

niko:
I think I need to go in the Tower?

george:
Seriously? You haven't figured that one out yet?

niko:
I don't know how to get in!

george:
Well, I don't know either.
Shouldn't Player help you with that?

george:
All I know is that nobody from this world can get in there.

george:
Not beyond that tiny entrance room, anyway.

george:
If anything, there might be a book on how the Messiah of all people can get in.

george:
But I don't got anything like that in MY collection.

george:
Would like to, though.

niko:
I see...

george:
Siiiiigh.

niko:
Um... hi?

george:
...Hi.

niko:
Are you alright?

george:
....

niko:
....

george:
Can I... help you...

niko:
Yeah!

niko:
I was wondering if you can tell me what I should do next?

niko:
I...think I'm supposed to go in the Tower.

george:
...the Tower....
A grim obelisk... a solemn reminder of our fate.

george:
We're all gonna dieeeeeee....

niko:
Um...

niko:
...so...how do I... Get in?

george:
I don't know...!!!
I've been reading and studying all my life, and yet...

george:
I haven't even found any books about entering the Tower!

george:
Oh, I know there's a small room you can go in, but...
Everybody knows that!

niko:
I see...

george:
Helloooo
!
You must be the savior!

george:
I'm soooo happy I actually get to meet you! <3

niko:
It's nice to meet you too, miss!

george:
So! Are you here to check out the archives?
I can give you a tour!

niko:
Actually...
I need your help!

niko:
Can you tell me what I need to do next?
I think... I'm supposed to go in the Tower...

george:
Yup!

niko:
Do you know how I can get in?

george:
Nope!

george:
Gosh, I don't think ANYONE's supposed to get inside the Tower!

george:
I mean, there's a little room that you can go into...
But there's no stairs or elevators or anything else...

george:
If you want my guess, you'll probably need Player's help?

george:
I don't know how exactly...

george:
In my experience, that kind of knowledge is usually recorded in some sort of cryptic book.

george:
But I haven't read anything like that before...
Sorry!

niko:
Ah...

george:
Oh, hello there!

george:
You must be the savior!

george:
And also, the cutest darn thing I have ever seen!

niko:
U- um...
Thank you!

george:
Can I help you with anything, sweetie?

niko:
Mhm!
I want to know what I should do next!

niko:
I think I'm supposed to go in the Tower?

george:
Oooh that's right, the Tower!

george:
I know there's a small room that you can go into, but...

george:
...I'm afraid nobody knows how to get in beyond that!

george:
Not even silly ol' me, who spent her entire life reading books about the world...

niko:
Ah...

george:
I think you need some help from Player, but I don't know any details!

george:
I've never found any books about this before...
You'd think there would be at least ONE book on this, but I guess that's just how it is!

george:
Goodness, this is quite the dilemma!

george:
Hey, lil' fella!

niko:
Hello!

george:
So you're gonna like, save the world and stuff!
Didn't think I'd run into ya. But now I did!

george:
Eyyyyyy.

niko:
Um, thanks?

george:
So like, what up?
Can I getcha anything?

niko:
Yeah! I heard you can help me!

niko:
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now...

niko:
I think I'm supposed to go in the Tower...
But how do I do that?

george:
Ya don't.
At least, WE don't.

george:
The Tower's only got one teeny room in it, it ain't even got stairs!

george:
I bet you need Player's help on this one, pal...
Exactly how? I dunno.

george:
But I bet'cha anything that sorta knowledge is in some mystery book somewhere.

george:
Nothin' in my collection fits the description, tho.

niko:
Ah...

niko:
A book is poking out from the shelf.

niko:
Ah, this looks like a sketchbook of some sort!

niko:
A book is poking out from the shelf.

niko:
Hey!

niko:
I think this book is actually about clovers...

niko:
A book is poking out from the shelf.

niko:
A box full of notebooks.

niko:
Looks like a scanner.

niko:
Looks like a printer.

niko:
We should get going now, Player.

niko:
I don't think this is a good time for a nap, Player...

niko:
I'm a little tired from walking.

niko:
Is it alright if I take a nap?

unknown:


niko:
Ah, well...
I suppose there's more work to do.

niko:
It's a stack of blank papers.

niko:
Boxes full of manuscripts.

niko:
A book on the ground.

unknown:
Nope... not looking forward to that water shortage.

unknown:
Oh, hey there.

niko:
You have a lot of fish!

unknown:
Yeah... I'm worried about them.

niko:
Oh?

unknown:
I heard something about how the square particle stuff just took out a major pipeline.

unknown:
I guess I should take advantage of the running water while I still can...

niko:
It's a big fishtank!

kelvin:
[You have been here for a while...]
[Are you sure you do not wish to stay?]

niko:
I'm good, thanks for offering though!

niko:
So... where did you find all your cats?

kelvin:
[They found me on their own.]
[So I stay here now.]

niko:
Ah...
Well, it's good that you're not alone, at least!

niko:
I met some robots in the other areas stationed all by themselves...

niko:
I felt kinda... bad...

kelvin:
[With robots, it is alright.]

kelvin:
[We are not like people, we are typically unable to feel loneliness.]

niko:
Right...

niko:
Well, you talk less like a robot than most other robots I've met!

kelvin:
[Maybe.]

kelvin:
[Not many people frequent this part of the alley, but there are a few.]

kelvin:
[One of them even lives here.]

niko:
I see...

niko:
It's warm here!

kelvin:
[Yeah.]

kelvin:
[This was my original purpose.]

niko:

Oooh!

niko:
It's a nice purpose!.....
...yawn...

kelvin:
[Oh, you look tired.]
[Do you wish to rest?]

niko:
I can't sleep now! Player and I got stuff to do!

kelvin:
[I see.]

kelvin:
[Oh, a cat.]

kelvin:
[Are you lost?]

niko:
Me?

kelvin:
[Do you wish to join us?]

niko:
Join... your cats?

kelvin:
[Yes.]

niko:
But I'm not a cat...

niko:
I don't walk on four legs like they do...

kelvin:
[You have cat eyes.]

niko:
My eyes are normal people eyes...

niko:
Well, normal back home!

kelvin:
[Your hat is shaped like a cat.]

niko:
But I'm just a person!

kelvin:
[You are still welcome here.]

kelvin:
[I protect lost people as well.]

niko:
Thanks! But I'm not lost though!

niko:
I've got Player to guide me!

kelvin:
[I see.]

unknown:
I see you have the club uniform.

unknown:
You may come in.

niko:
A curious marking on the wall.

niko:
It looks like a... ram...?

niko:
It's strangely warm in this room.

I see you have the club uniform.

niko:

niko:
It's a faded flyer.

niko:
It's a big crack in the wall!

niko:
I see bunch of mice, huddled together.

niko:
...oh, but they scurried off...

niko:
I hope they didn't think I was gonna eat them...

niko:
A bed.

niko:
The blanket has quite a few patches.

niko:
An empty glass jar with a wire handle.

niko:
Some empty glass jars.

niko:
A jar full of red glowing fluid.

niko:
A lantern plant.

niko:
There's a note attached.

niko:
It says "Thank you for working so hard, Mr. Lamplighter!"

niko:
A framed photo of someone.

niko:
Empty coffee cups.

niko:
There's an empty coffee cup on the chair.

niko:
Big books.

niko:
...Ah, these are dictionaries.

niko:
Some of the words are underlined.

niko:
....*most* of the words are underlined.

niko:
A rusty metal garbage can.

niko:
There's some broken glass in here.

niko:
An empty glass jar.

niko:
The handle on this one looks broken.

niko:
There's some big plastic disks in here.

niko:
Looks like they're supposed to go in something?

niko:
...

niko:
Wait, Player, are we really gonna take these with us?

niko:
But they look so heavy...

niko:
Alright...

niko:
Hey! They're actually pretty light!

niko:
It's empty now...

niko:
It's a big book.

niko:
The title says "understanding robots".

shepherd:
So.....

shepherd:
We meet again.

niko:
Hello...

niko:
Wait!

niko:
Aren't you from...the village?

shepherd:
Yes, but the rams are ever-present.
In the village, in the city...

unknown:


shepherd:
even... in your heart.

niko:
...okay.

shepherd:
If rams wore shoes...

shepherd:
They would have... flip-flops.

niko:
...I don't get it.

shepherd:
I used to host the official RAM club wiki site...

shepherd:
...but we kept having page faults due to rams getting out of the server room.

niko:
...what?

shepherd:
404 ram not found.

niko:
I have no idea what any of that meant.

shepherd:
Hmp. I guess that's it for my jokes.

shepherd:
It cannot be helped...
..they were quite b-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-d.

unknown:


niko:
...

niko:
I got that one!

niko:
It's...good to see you too...

niko:
This ram doesn't react to me at all...

niko:
Instead, the word "baa" is written on its wool.

shepherd:
That one isn't a RAM.

shepherd:
That one is... Read-Only.

niko:
I...see...

niko:
An electric kettle.

niko:
Looks like it's boiling water.

shepherd:
Oh, right, it's almost lunch time.

shepherd:
Would you like to stay for a nice cup of...

shepherd:
...RAMen?

niko:
...

niko:
I'll... pass...

shepherd:
Come to think of it, we're probably out of ramen.

niko:
Ow!

shepherd:
Careful, if you touch a SRAM...
You're in for a shock!

shepherd:
A STATIC shock!

niko:
Don't "baa" at me...

niko:
There's no one here...

niko:
It's a big tree, with leaves!
Haven't seen one of these since I was back home...

niko:
There's no one here...

niko:
It's a big tree, with leaves!
Haven't seen one of these since I was back home...

niko:
Whoa!
Player? Did you see that fox just now?

niko:
It just ran behind the tree...

rue:
...

rue:
I'm sorry if you are looking for me.

rue:
But I cannot talk to you.

rue:
Not now...

niko:
Um...

rue:
...

rue:
But... can you promise me something?

niko:
Huh?

rue:
If... you can find a way to return...

rue:
...please do.

niko:
Er...What... do you mean by that?

niko:
...
No reply...

rue:
We will meet again.

niko:
...?

rue:
So you found a way back after all.

niko:
Eh?
But I've never been here before...

rue:
That means...

rue:
...

rue:
Have you... met the others?

niko:
...others?
You're the only fox I've seen...

niko:
Wait! There's that one plush in Calamus and Alula's house, right Player?

rue:
...

rue:
Sigh.

rue:
It's not time.

niko:
...?

rue:
...we will meet again.

rue:
Hello, Niko.

niko:
Hello...

rue:
...oh?

rue:
You're back again...

rue:
But...I said it was not time...

niko:
...?

rue:
...

rue:
Are you here to keep me company, then?

rue:
Guess I can't refuse that.

rue:
...I am Rue.

rue:
You will probably not remember my name in a while.
..But I would still like to know yours.

niko:
I'm... not sure what you're talking about.

niko:
But my name is Niko!

rue:
...Niko.

rue:
I shall remember that!

rue:
I'm glad you do not mind coming back.

rue:
To be perfectly honest...

rue:
It may be this way for a while, actually.

niko:
...?

rue:
...But in time, that will change.

niko:
The... sun?

rue:
Player can see this, right?

niko:
...yeah?

rue:
Then Player will understand.

rue:
Oh, you're here!

rue:
I was starting to miss you...

rue:
...Guess I got used to your company, after all.

niko:
...pardon?

rue:
Do not worry. Carry on.

niko:
Player and I fixed the camera!

unknown:
Aw, sweet!

unknown:
Are you here for your photos?

niko:
Actually, yeah!

niko:
I need to take a picture for.... reasons.

unknown:
Well, I got good news and bad news.

unknown:
The good news is that the photo center is right behind me.

niko:
The bad news is that.... it doesn't work, right?

unknown:
Heh, you're catching on quick.

unknown:
After operations ended in the Barrens, this place got shut down.

unknown:
All of the engineers lost their jobs and became street vendors.

niko:
Maybe Player and I can figure it out from them!

unknown:
That's good!

unknown:
It would certainly help out people with expired IDs.

unknown:
...Like me.

unknown:
Are you here for your photos?

niko:
No?

unknown:
Alrighty then.

unknown:
I'll just... uh...

unknown:
...stand here.

unknown:
Hey kid!

unknown:
Want some soup dumplings? They're guaranteed to contain only a minimal amount of industrial byproducts!

niko:
I'll... pass...

niko:
Can you tell me how to get the camera working again?

unknown:
Yes, yes, certainly. The thick lens should be positioned to the left of both of the curved lenses.

niko:
Actually... I do want to hear about it!

unknown:
Curiosity killed the cat, eh?

niko:
I'm not a cat...

unknown:
Ok so!

unknown:
I've invented a medicine to prepare everyone for the upcoming water shortage!

unknown:
All you gotta do is dissolve one of these pills in water.

unknown:
And then you drink the water.

unknown:
And then you never need to drink water again!

niko:
What!

unknown:
It also makes plants grow faster!

niko:
How... does it work?

unknown:
Here, why don't you take a free sample?

niko:
Oh!

niko:
Thanks?

unknown:
Don't thank me! Go spread the word!

unknown:
Hey hey!

unknown:
Ready for me to blow your mind?

unknown:
Ok so!

niko:
Oh!

niko:
Thanks?

unknown:
Don't thank me! Go spread the word!

unknown:
Aww, but...

niko:
Can you tell me how to fix the camera?

unknown:
Hmm... It's been a while.

unknown:
I'm pretty sure that the bulgy lens goes on one of the ends, but I forget which.

unknown:
This is going to help so many people...

unknown:
...and also make me rich and famous and cool.

unknown:
Actually... I exaggerated.

unknown:
The effects of the pill wears off in like a week.

unknown:
But all you have to do is just take another pill!

niko:
Can you tell me how to fix the camera?

unknown:
Hmm... It's been a while.

unknown:
I'm pretty sure that the bulgy lens goes on one of the ends, but I forget which.

niko:
This stand smells a bit like burnt sugar...

unknown:
Yup... still gettin' the hang of making these fried candy skewers...

unknown:
They don't taste too bad, though! Do you want one?

niko:
It's okay, thank you!

niko:
You used to be one of the camera engineers, right?

unknown:
The camera? Oh, joyous memories. We went through thick and thin together.

unknown:
And by that I mean the concave lens did.

niko:
This smells kinda nice!

niko:
What is it?

unknown:
Breaded fish!

unknown:
I toasted the bread myself!

niko:
...I... see...

niko:
Is there anything you remember about how to work the camera?

unknown:
Let me see... When arranging the lenses, make sure that the thin lens is positioned between the two curved ones.

plight:
Well, good luck...

niko:
You too! With the lamp.

plight:
Hey, you lookin for something?

niko:
Yeah... I need to go find a library card now...
Any idea where I can get one?

plight:
From... the... library?

niko:
I tried that already!
The person in charge wasn't here.

plight:
Oh, uh...

plight:
Maybe check out the factory? You just take the stairs at the end of this street and make a turn.

plight:
There's a lot of scientists there.
Scientists... read books, right?

plight:
They might help you...

niko:
He looks busy...

plight:
You can tell, huh...

plight:
Oh, hey there.

plight:
You, uh... doing okay?

niko:
Yup!
What are you doing?

plight:
Just filling this lamp here...

plight:
It's... taking a while...

plight:
I... think it might be leaking...

plight:
Well, good luck...

plight:
Thanks for taking them off my hands, I guess?
The lenses, that is.

plight:
The scientists wanted me to use them to fix the camera in the photo booth, but...

plight:
...you can imagine how that went.

plight:
I'm just glad I didn't break anything...

plight:
Hey! Isn't that...

You heard me??

plight:
(IT KEEPS HAPPENING.)

niko:
...sorry about breaking into your house.
We didn't actually break anything, but...

niko:
Player said I should take these plastic disks, for some reason?
Should we put them back?

plight:
It's okay, keep 'em.

plight:
I wouldn't have been able to fix that machine anyway...

niko:
A bunch of words are on the screen.

niko:
I don't understand any of it...

unknown:
The luminescence index of liquid red phosphor decreased by a factor of 3.57% this past week.

unknown:
Alarming, to say the least... that's the sharpest decline I've seen, and the number is only increasing.

unknown:
We will have to further concentrate the phosphor now, for it to be of any use.

unknown:
It's hard to believe, but there's a good chance this city could run out of light in as little as six months.

unknown:
...What are we going to do?

unknown:
If the city runs out of light, well...
I don't want to think about what happens then.

niko:

niko:
Hey Player?

niko:
Doesn't the lady look...kind of familiar to you?

niko:
I wonder if she's related to the robot lady who gave me the amber.

niko:
I almost want to ask her about it...

niko:
...should I?

niko:
She's still asleep...

unknown:
None of us have been sleeping very well in light of recent events...

unknown:
The square particles took out a few of my robots last week, and

niko:
...

niko:
She fell asleep...

unknown:
I can barely keep my eyes open, man...

unknown:
How does Dr. Silverpoint get all that energy?

unknown:
Hmm... I wonder what The Author would do in this situation...

unknown:
Dr. Silverpoint usually references his works.

niko:
A coffee machine. It's almost empty.

niko:
A warm pot of coffee.

unknown:
Monitoring...monitoring....

unknown:
I'm picking up some more disruptions in sector 8 of the city.

unknown:
This is consistent with our earlier findings... not good at all...

unknown:
The Barrens engineer just reported another sighting of the particles in the cliff area.

unknown:
...well, nothing unusal at this point.

unknown:
Ugh, those squares particles just took out two of my robots in the Glen.

unknown:
We might have to put off the water analysis project for now.

niko:
I want to press all of the buttons...
But I must resist!

niko:
There sure are a lot of computers here...
And they look important, too.

unknown:
These robots are malfunctioning at a frightening rate.

unknown:
Physical damage from square-particle anomalies is almost impossible to revert.

unknown:
No living person can touch them, unless they have a death wish.

unknown:
...But if we're lucky, sometimes the squares go away on their own.

unknown:
...but not before taking away one of the robot's arms, or legs.

unknown:
...or head.

niko:
...okay.

unknown:
I don't know if you've ever seen a headless robot before, but it is quite a sight to behold.

unknown:
And also quite dangerous.

unknown:
[I CANNOT STOP SPINNING.]

unknown:
This is so tedious!

unknown:
I miss the good ol' days before our robot-repairing-robots broke down.

Now all the robots have to be assembled by actual people.

niko:
But... aren't you a robot?

unknown:
No?

I mean, Do I SOUND like a robot to you?

niko:
Not really.

niko:
But... your head is a tv?

unknown:
W...what does that have to do with anything?

niko:
...

niko:
...nevermind.

We should probably fix the robot-repairing-robots first.

But the higher-ups need these guys done first for some reason...

A robot.

You should hold on to that amber, okay?

niko:
I will!

kip:
....oh?

kip:
T...that's.....

kip:
How...did you get this?

niko:
This robot lady in the Barrens gave it to me!

niko:
She looked... kinda like you?

kip:
I see...

kip:
...

kip:
Sigh.
It was supposed to be such a breakthrough, y'know?

kip:
I even based her on myself so I'll KNOW it works!

niko:
Break...through?

kip:
We wanted to build a robot that acts like a person, thinks like a person...

kip:
...a robot that isn't bound by its own code.

niko:
Oh!

kip:
But turns out, you can't really BUILD something like that.

kip:
Too many contradictions in the code... made her unstable.

kip:
...that was the only time I've ever seen a robot go rogue.

kip:
Scariest day of my life, tell you what!

niko:
...rogue?

niko:
But...she seemed so nice when we talked!

niko:
...even if she talked a little weird...

kip:
Ah, she's been repaired for some time now.

kip:
My friend was able to stabilize her volatile state through his own means.

kip:
A real miracle worker, that...

kip:
After he was through, she ended up turning out just like how I wanted.

kip:
...but the damage was already done.

kip:
...I gave up on her back then... we all did.

kip:
I'm sure she realized that...
and now she won't ever come back.

kip:
She won't even answer my letters...

niko:
I'm sorry...

kip:
Ah, sorry for rambling.

kip:
You should hold on to that amber, okay?

niko:
I will!

kip:
Oh! I see you put your own photo on there!
Does that mean your name is Kip now?

kip:
...that was a joke.

kip:
Is there anything else you need?

niko:
Nope!

kip:
Well, feel free to stick around if you want!

kip:
Oh hey, you're back!

kip:
Can I help you with anything else?

niko:
Yeah...

niko:
Do you know how I can get a library card?

kip:
A library card?

kip:
You'll have to ask the library for that!

niko:
I tried...

niko:
I need it to see the head librarian, but I can't get to see her without a library card

niko:
...but at the same time, she's the one who gives out library cards...

kip:
Really...

kip:
Heh...that sounds like George alright!

kip:
I'm sorry you caught her on a bad day!

niko:
Aw...

kip:
...wait, I know!

kip:
I can just give you my library card!

kip:
It won't be hard for me to get another one.

niko:
Wow, thanks!

kip:
There! You're all set, I think...

kip:
Wait.

kip:
Shoot!

kip:
I forgot...the front desk library bots have facial recognition

kip:
And my photo on the card won't match you...

kip:
...unless I tape a photo of my face to your face!

niko:
Um-

kip:
That was a joke.

kip:
Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and the robot will take it anyway!

kip:
Worse comes to worse, you can always find somewhere to take a photo.

kip:
Don't overwork yourself, okay?

kip:
Your journey is just as important as your end goal.

kip:
Cliche, but true!

kip:
So...

kip:
You've been walking all over the world, huh?

niko:
M-hm!

kip:
Geez...I can't imagine...

kip:
Do you get really tired sometimes?

niko:
Kinda...

niko:
But I don't mind!
It's actually really pretty!

kip:
Haha, I'm glad you think so!

kip:
Even with the sun gone, the world is still a beautiful place.

niko:
What did the world look like with the sun?

kip:
Oh, uh...

kip:
...y'know, it's kind of embarassing to admit how little of it I have actually seen.

niko:
...oh?

kip:
Ironic, isn't it?

kip:
Even though I'm the world's leading researcher...
..All I do is stay here and build robots.

kip:
They're the ones exploring the world, I just write down the data, crunch numbers, generate graphs...

niko:
Right... I've been seeing robots everywhere!

niko:
I just thought it was cuz the world was too dangerous for most people to explore...

kip:
That's not far from the truth, actually.

kip:
But I know someone who still does his research firsthand!

niko:
Oh?

kip:
...even after segments of land started collapsing and access to the more remote areas became difficult.

kip:
I mean, he outright built a machine that could fly!
Something we all thought was not physically possible!

niko:
Oh! That's...

kip:
I asked him about working with us, so he provides us with all sorts of insights from time to time.

kip:
...but for some reason, he REALLY didn't want to build robots.

kip:
Or, more specifically, coding them.

niko:
How come?

kip:
Beats me! I mean, he's happy to work with robots!

kip:
In fact, he even- ..

kip:
...ah. It's been a while since we last talked.
He must be busy with his books now, yeah.

niko:
...Hello?

kip:
Oh, shoot!

kip:
If I had known you would be here so soon, I would've turned off the darned lock!

kip:
Hello there!

kip:
Sorry about the weird... security measures.

niko:
It's okay!

niko:
Player helped me solve it!

kip:
Did they now!

kip:
So... can I help you with anything?

niko:
Yeah...

niko:
Do you know how I can get a library card?

kip:
A library card?

kip:
You'll have to ask the library for that!

niko:
I tried...

niko:
I need it to see the head librarian, but I can't get to see her without a library card

niko:
...but at the same time, she's the one who gives out library cards...

kip:
Really...

kip:
Heh...that sounds like George alright!

kip:
I'm sorry you caught her on a bad day!

niko:
Aw...

kip:
...wait, I know!

kip:
I can just give you my library card!

kip:
It won't be hard for me to get another one.

niko:
Wow, thanks!

kip:
There! You're all set, I think...

kip:
Wait.

kip:
Shoot!

kip:
I forgot...the front desk library bots have facial recognition.

kip:
And my photo on the card won't match you...

kip:
...unless I tape a photo of my face to your face!

niko:
Um-

kip:
That was a joke.

kip:
Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky and the robot will take it anyway!

kip:
Worse comes to worse, you can always find somewhere to take a photo.

kip:
Oh, shoot!

kip:
If I had known you would be here so soon, I would've turned off the system!

kip:
Hello there!

kip:
Sorry about the weird... security measures.

niko:
It's okay!

niko:
Player helped me solve it!

kip:
Did they now!

kip:
So... can I help you with anything?

niko:
Yeah, where's the library?

kip:
The library? That's all the way on the other side of town!

kip:
The fastest route is where you take the shortcut through the backalley, but...

niko:
I think that's how we got here, actually!

kip:
Oh good!

kip:
You should head back to that direction and walk to the east a bit.

kip:
You'll find it eventually!

niko:
Thank you!

niko:
Something is poking out from this shelf.

niko:
It's a tube of glitter glue.

kip:
You can have that if you want!

kip:
Never know when you need to glitter things up, right?

niko:
Oh! Are you sure?

kip:
Yeah! I have tons of those!

niko:
Thank you!

niko:
Uh... cheese?

niko:
Ouch, m-my eyes...

niko:
It's a photo of me!

niko:
...are my eyes always this big?

niko:
It's another photo of me!

niko:
Good thinking, Player. It's a good idea to have a backup.

niko:
It's another photo of me...

niko:
Three is enough, right?

niko:
It's another photo of me...

niko:
This is kind of fun!

niko:
It's a photo of me.

niko:
This one turned out pretty good!

niko:
It's a photo of me.

niko:
Oh no!
I blinked in this one...

niko:
It's another photo of me!

niko:
Nice.

niko:
It's a photo of me.

niko:
All of these are turning out pretty good!

niko:
It's a photo of me.

niko:
How many of these do we need, Player?

niko:
It's a photo of me...

niko:
And the camera is out of film now...

niko:
There's a slot here.
Looks like paper or something might come out from it.

niko:
It's out of film...

niko:
...
I guess that wasn't the right combination, Player.

niko:
...
It didn't do anything.

niko:
It looks like I can unlock this door...

ed:
[Hello, Niko.]

niko:
H... hello...

ed:
[Congratulations. You are now inside the Tower.]

niko:
Are you talking.....to me, now?

ed:
[Correct.]

niko:
But you were always talking to Player before...

niko:
Where's ...

ed:
[Player has already left.]

ed:
[I had to resort to contacting you directly.]

niko:
Wait, so... Player is gone, just like that?

ed:
[Correct.]

niko:
....for good?

ed:
[Correct.]

ed:
[Player has already finished their mission.]

ed:
[...and so have you, Niko.]

ed:
[Here, you can rest now.]

ed:
[Everything that's happened here is like a bad dream.]

ed:
[When you wake up, you will be home.]

niko:
Oh!

niko:
...

niko:
But...

ed:
[What's wrong?]

niko:
...I thought there'd be more to it, you know?

niko:
I thought... we were supposed to go to the top of the Tower...

niko:
I thought there was supposed to be somewhere we need to put the sun in.

niko:
And now... I don't even HAVE the sun anymore...

niko:
And Player is just... gone...

niko:
This feels wrong!

ed:
[But you did good. You saved the world, Niko.]

ed:
[Are you not happy?]

niko:
I guess I am...

niko:
But... It's just...

niko:
...

ed:
[...]

ed:
[...you're still here...]

ed:
[...Niko, why are you still here?]

niko:
...I never even got to say goodbye to Player...

niko:
It's the lightbulb.
Thank goodness it's safe...

niko:
...
..

niko:
...I guess Player isn't coming back...

unknown:


niko:
...Player?

unknown:


niko:
Is that... really you?

niko:
I thought... you were gone...

unknown:


niko:
Oh! I was... feeling a bit scared back there...

niko:
I thought I was completely alone!

niko:
But that was silly of me to assume, wasn't it?

niko:
Where did you go?

niko:
I was so scared all by myself...

niko:
...but I guess... it's okay now.

niko:
Ah, guess we need to figure out where to go now, and-

niko:
The sun!
It lit up on its own!

niko:
Guess I should pick it up, right Player?

niko:
It won't turn on.

ed:
[How do you still have the remote??]

niko:
I wonder where that light is coming from...

niko:
It's a little tree.

niko:
It's a mirror!

niko:
Just a toilet...

niko:
It's a metal bathtub.

niko:
There's nothing in the fridge...

niko:
It's a sink.

niko:
The wood is neatly stacked in the fireplace.

niko:
It's a sink.

niko:
...
Sure is taking a while...

niko:
I guess this elevator leads to the top of the Tower, Player...

niko:
...

niko:
...are you excited, Player?
We're finally gonna save the world...

niko:
And I know it's for real this time, cuz you're here!

niko:
And then...
..I'll get to go home for real this time, too!

niko:
I can't wait to see everyone again...

niko:
Are you okay, Player?
You seem a little quiet...

unknown:


niko:
...yeah?

niko:
...?

unknown:


niko:
...I'm listening.

niko:
What's going on, Player?

unknown:


niko:
...?

unknown:


niko:
...wh ..what's that supposed to mean, Player?

unknown:


niko:
What??
..But won't that...
..But won't that end the world?

unknown:


niko:
I don't want that to happen...

niko:
So... what happens when we save the world?
..what happens to me...?

unknown:


niko:
You... don't?

niko:
...

niko:
.....

niko:
The world below looks so small...

niko:
No turning back now...

niko:
So this is where the sun belongs...

niko:
If I put the sun in here, we'll be able to save the world, right?

niko:
...but if I want to go home... I'll have to... break it?

niko:
Oh....

niko:
....Player?
What should I... do?

unknown:
What's the right thing to do?

niko:
Y-You're right...
I can't just leave everyone here to die.

niko:
Thank you for your help, Player.
I promise I'll be okay.

credits:
Thanks for Playing!

unknown:
I... trust your judgement, Player.

niko:
Player?
...What happened?
It's very dark in here...

niko:
...Oh!
I can see a light at the end of this passage!

niko:
I think I hear a voice too...

niko:
Mama?
I can hear her calling me!

niko:
All I need to do is pass through this wall...
I'll finally be home again.

niko:
...

niko:
Ah, Player,
I guess...

niko:
I guess this is goodbye...

niko:
I'm.... glad... I got to meet you, Player...

niko:
Thank you for everything.

credits:
Thanks for Playing!

They're in the door...

They're in the door...

Isn't that...the city gate?

niko:
It's...

niko:
The bridge is out...

niko:
The bridge is broken...

niko:
They're in the door...

niko:
...looks like parts of the ground is missing.

niko:
I wonder if it's safe to walk across these vines...

niko:
...one way to find out, I guess...

niko:
They're safe...

niko:
...

niko:
...

niko:
I... think I remember something...

niko:
I remember... what I did at the end.

niko:
I remember... putting in the sun...

niko:
And then everything got really bright...

niko:
I... remember being in a dark room.

niko:
There was a light at the end of a long hallway...

niko:
I thought I was going back home, but...

niko:
I... don't remember a lot of the details.

niko:
...

niko:
...But none of it matters now, does it?

niko:
I just got brought back anyway....

niko:
...

niko:
.....

niko:
We can't go back now, Player.

niko:
I'm not sleepy anymore.

niko:
I can't sleep now, Player!
I need to get Calamus and Alula to the sacred grounds.

niko:
I can't sleep now, Player!
I need to get Alula to her brother first.

niko:
I'm a little tired from walking.

niko:
Is it alright if I take a nap?

unknown:


niko:
Ah, well...
I suppose there's more work to do.

unknown:
[PLEASE TAKE CARE TO NOT TOUCH THE SQUARES.
I CANNOT GUARANTEE YOUR WELLBEING IF YOU DO.]

niko:
Gotcha.

unknown:
[THESE SQUARES APPEARED MERE MINUTES AGO.]

niko:
Really?

niko:
I've been seeing a lot of them in doorways and stuff...

unknown:
[NOT A GOOD SIGN.]

niko:
...huh?

[THE WORLD'S DETERIORATION IS ACCELERATING.]

[HELLO, PEOPLE.]

I'm one of 'em!

[TWO CHILDREN RESIDE NEAR HERE.]

maize:
Do not worry.
I am fine.

maize:
Hello...

niko:
I... um...have something to ask of you...

maize:
...yes?

niko:
It looks like most of the bridges around the Glen are broken, and...

maize:
...that's right...the bridges...

maize:
You... need to cross them on your pilgrimage....

maize:
...would you...like me to fix them?

niko:
Yeah! Is it possible?

maize:
...

maize:
...difficult.

maize:
...bridges... are in very specific locations, over water...

maize:
...need to find the right points...
vines must be very strong, too...

maize:
...an undertaking.

niko:
Ah...

maize:
...but, possible.

maize:
I... intend to use the last of my strength.

niko:
...

maize:
...please stand back.

niko:
...

niko:
...what... happened?

niko:
Are you okay...?

niko:
...are you...

niko:
...

niko:
...

maize:
...S...savior...

maize:
...... you're...here to see me...?

niko:
...what... happened to you?

maize:
...
hold on.

maize:
...I.... need to concentrate

niko:
...?

maize:
!!!!

maize:
...the islands... will collapse...if I don't do something...

maize:
...that's why... the vines...

niko:
...you're... making the vines grow...

niko:
...is that why there are vines everywhere?

niko:
Are you... trying to hold the land together?

maize:
My powers... the best I could do. Yes.

niko:
That's...

niko:
Should I leave the sun here for you?
I know you wanted to see it...

maize:
...

maize:
...tempting...
But I musn't...

maize:
...the sun brings me comfort, but...

maize:
Stress is good... for this, fear is good...

maize:
...makes me strong....vines grow faster.

niko:
But...

maize:
If I'm at ease... the vines might retreat.

niko:
...

maize:
They're all in danger, savior...

maize:
The villagers... the children...

maize:
...my final hours...mustn't go to waste.

maize:
The people deserve to live... even if just for another day...

niko:
...

niko:
The pathway is blocked....

niko:
...by blocks!

niko:
...

niko:
Waaaait a minute.
I remember something about this...

niko:
Never knew it'd be so easy!

niko:
...(ow my foot ow)

niko:
The squares are blocking the doorway...

alula:
Oh...
The door...

calamus:
I knew we'd lose our home eventually, but...
I wasn't expecting it to happen so soon...

niko:
Oh jeez!
Are you guys okay?

calamus:
Oh my stars!
You're... the savior!

alula:
!!!

calamus:
Um....uh....

calamus:
It's an honor to meet you!

alula:
Yes!

calamus:
I'd invite you inside, but as you can see, our home is...

alula:
It's got squares in it!

calamus:
Yes, Alula, thank you.

niko:
It's... getting everywhere now... isn't it?

calamus:
Hm?

niko:
The squares... there are way more than before!

niko:
Even the gate to the Refuge is destroyed now.
That didn't happen last time!

calamus:
...last time?

niko:
.....

calamus:
.....

niko:
Uhh...
othing!

niko:
(almost let that slip, Player...)

niko:
Guess I should introduce myself again...
My name is Niko!

calamus:
Ni...ko...

calamus:
Oh gosh! Would it not be rude to call you by name?

niko:
No worries, Calamus!

calamus:
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME!?

niko:
I... um... uh...

niko:
(not again!)

alula:
The messiah just knows these things, Calamus!

alula:
Riiiight?

niko:
Y-yes! Of course!

niko:
(phew)

calamus:
Ah... you were saying... about the gate?

niko:
Oh, right!

niko:
Looks like I can't get in the city through the old gate anymore...

niko:
Do... either of you know another way to get in?

niko:
I remember... I mean, I HEARD that there's some sort of hidden passage around here somewhere!

calamus:
Oh!
The passage to the burial grounds?

niko:
That's the one!

calamus:
Oh... but I'm not sure if that'll be of any use here...

calamus:
It's been flooded for a long time, and there's no boat...

calamus:
Not to mention, the burial grounds itself is pretty far from the city!

niko:
That's ok! I would still like to see it!

niko:
It's the only lead we have...

calamus:
Alright, in that case...

calamus:
...please follow us.

niko:
It's a ball.

alula:
That's mine!
It doesn't bounce around as much as it used to, though...

calamus:
At least the courtyard is unaffected for now...

alula:
We usually get to the burial grounds through our friend, but...

alula:
...he hasn't been here in forever!

calamus:
Normally this courtyard would be where we meet up...

alula:
I hope he comes back soon...

alula:
...Niko!

alula:
Niko? What's wrong?

calamus:
You looked like you were about to faint!

niko:
...

niko:
It's... not the first time it's happened.

calamus:
...oh?

niko:
Earlier I was in the Barrens, and I...
saw something like this too.

niko:
It was like a dream, but only for a split second...

calamus:
...sounds like a vision.

calamus:
Like something a prophet would see!

niko:
I... guess?
The robot lady I was with earlier had a fancy word for it, though...

niko:
Wait...

niko:
Lemme... check something.

niko:
Oh!
I was right!

calamus:
...huh?

niko:
When I had the vision back at the Barrens... the book started glowing too!

niko:
I wanted to see if I could get it to happen again, and...

alula:
Where did you get that!!!

niko:
Oh, uh... I had it with me when I woke up in this world!

alula:
It looks like one of our friend's books!

alula:
...Except it's glowy!

niko:
...that's what the lady said too...

niko:
Hm...

niko:
Player... let's see if we can do anything with the journal in this room...

alula:
I wonder when our friend will come back...

alula:
Woah!

calamus:
How did that boat get there?

niko:
...

niko:
Okay, I'm pretty sure it has to do with this journal, now...

niko:
The exact same thing happened back at the Barrens.

calamus:
Seriously?

niko:
The journal was glowing, so I wanted to take a closer look at it.

niko:
Then, I found a page that looked like a drawing of the room we were in, and then...

niko:
A minecart showed up!

calamus:
What!

alula:
What!

calamus:
That sounds freaky...

alula:
No it doesn't!

alula:
Player must've done something!

calamus:
Still...

alula:
...Hey! We have a boat now!

alula:
We can go to the burial grounds and visit mom again!

calamus:
But...

alula:
Come on, Calamus!

alula:
Niko and Player are with us!

calamus:
Well...
if Player made the boat appear... it should be safe...

niko:
What... do you think, Player?

alula:
Can we go yet?

calamus:
This passage must be where fireflies congregate...

calamus:
I wonder how long this passage is...

calamus:
Looks like there's some lights at the end...

alula:
Those are fireflies!

calamus:
We can leave whenever you're ready.

niko:
It's a clover.

alula:
Here we go!

alula:
Do you want to go back, Niko?

niko:
...Nah.

niko:
It's a clover.

[I HAVE LOST COMMUNICATION WITH THE GUARDIAN OUTSIDE THE CITY GATE.]

cedric:
It's you!

niko:
!

cedric:
You are Niko, right?

niko:
Mhm!

cedric:
You... um...

niko:
My name is Niko...

cedric:
Ah!

cedric:
N-nice finally to meet you! ...no, wait.

cedric:
It is a pleasure to be of acquaintance at last, Niko.

cedric:
My name is Cedric.

niko:
Oh!

niko:
I'm supposed to be looking for you too!

cedric:
I am aware.

cedric:
Prototype had contacted me earlier, saying that you would be on your way to the city.

niko:
He did?

cedric:
He sent me a message after his memories were restored.

niko:
Oh...

cedric:
He told me to wait in the city, but I thought it'd be faster for me to pick you guys up.

cedric:
...Turns out, that was a terrible idea.

niko:
Pick... us up?

niko:
...wait... YOU can fly that plane??

cedric:
What...is a plane?

niko:
That thing behind you!

cedric:
Oh! You mean the flying machine?

niko:
They're called planes in my world!

cedric:
Oh...

cedric:
...I did not realize they existed in other worlds...

niko:
...wait! Are you the friend that Calamus and Alula was talking about, then?

niko:
Is this the same flying machine they were talking about?

cedric:
I do not know anyone named Calamus or Alula.

cedric:
I think... they're meant to be friends with my father.
..in previous iterations of the...

niko:
...your father?

cedric:
He was the original owner of the flying machine...
..it's... one of his greatest inventions, actually.

niko:
YOUR DAD INVENTED PLANES???

cedric:
...flying machine.

niko:
IT'S COOL EITHER WAY!!

cedric:
Thanks?

cedric:
But to answer your earlier question... I am proficient in operating the machine.

cedric:
...but...something weird happened to the engine when I was in the air earlier...

cedric:
I had to make an emergency landing on this tiny island before I crashed into the city wall.

niko:
You almost crashed?
That's terrible!

cedric:
It was not pleasant, I will admit.


cedric:
I wonder if the engine problem has to do with the square particle disruptions...

cedric:
I checked, but... there isn't any of that square stuff inside the machine itself.

cedric:
...but I noticed some islands in the Glen are REALLY messed up now.

niko:
They are...

cedric:
Sigh.
Guess I should have listened to Proto in the first place.

cedric:
...say, where is he?

cedric:
He said he was coming with you...

cedric:
Is he still back at the main islands?

niko:
Oh... actually...

niko:
...back at the Barrens, he...

niko:
There was a cave-in... and then a bunch of squares...

niko:
...he... and the robot lady...

niko:
...neither of them made it out.

cedric:
...

cedric:
No....

niko:
...

niko:
He... did give me this, though.

niko:
This disk he pulled from his head...

cedric:
Oh!!!

cedric:
Oh thank goodness.

cedric:
He gave you his main drive!

cedric:
As long as I have this, I should be able to bring him back.

niko:
R-really?

cedric:
It's gonna be hard, but yes.

cedric:
You need all three of us for the big door.

niko:
The...?

cedric:
But first thing's first, we need to find a way to go to the city.

niko:
Right...
The city gate is kind of kaput now.

cedric:
If this machine was working, we could just fly right in there...

cedric:
I've isolated the issue with the machine, but I can't repair it with the stuff I have on hand.

niko:
Oh? What's wrong with it?

cedric:
The c[2]batteryc[0] in the engine is dead, and the engine has some c[2]gearsc[0] that need to be replaced.

niko:
...
Do you think you'll be able to fix it if Player and I help you find those things?

cedric:
...maybe.

cedric:
Problem is... the Glen isn't exactly a very high-tech area.

cedric:
...I'm not sure if you'll be able to find anything so specialized here.

niko:
We'll try anyway!

niko:
We can't really do anything else right now...

niko:
We found a battery...

cedric:
Oh, nice!

cedric:
I honestly wasn't expecting it...

niko:
It's from the generator on one of the islands.

cedric:
The research station?

niko:
Yeah.

niko:
It was powering all the robots there...
I felt bad for taking it...

cedric:
Ah...

cedric:
...we can always just give it back later.

niko:
Alright...

cedric:
We still need a few c[2]gearsc[0] to put this engine back together.
Please do what you must to find some.

niko:
We found a battery...

cedric:
Oh, nice!

cedric:
I honestly wasn't expecting it...

niko:
We found this one in the Barrens.
It wasn't working at first, but Player and I managed to fix it!

cedric:
Ah...

cedric:
...it's good that you thought to bring it with you then.

niko:
Yup!

cedric:
We still need a few c[2]gearsc[0] to put this engine back together.
Please do what you must to find some.

niko:
We found a music box!

niko:
It... should have gears in it, right?

cedric:
I assume so, but...
...

cedric:
This looks like one of the ones that my father made.

niko:
YOUR DAD MAKES MUSIC BOXES TOO?

cedric:
My dad makes a lot of things!

cedric:
Where did you get this from, by the way?

niko:
A trader from the village gave it to me!

cedric:
I see.
I remember father saying that he used to trade with some of the people here.

cedric:
He did always love traveling this world, despite...

cedric:
...well.

cedric:
Ah, sorry, I started rambling.

cedric:
The gears in there are compatible with the engine.

cedric:
Although it pains me to have to take it apart...

niko:
Oh... I'm sorry!

cedric:
It's fine...

cedric:
We still need a c[3]batteryc[0] to get this engine running.
Please do what you must to find one.

niko:
Sorry... I forgot...

niko:
What parts do we need to find again?

cedric:
We still need a c[3]batteryc[0] to get this engine running.

cedric:
We still need a few c[2]gearsc[0] to put this engine back together.

cedric:
A c[2]batteryc[0] for the engine, and a few c[2]gearsc[0] to replace the broken ones.

cedric:
If you could find me the parts I need, I should be able to get this machine off the ground again.

niko:
We made it!

calamus:
C'mon, Alula.
Let's go pay our respects...

alula:
Okay!

calamus:
At least I still got my sister...

calamus:
This is her grave...

niko:
Ah...

calamus:
It's been years, but...

calamus:
...It's still... hard, y'know?

niko:
...

calamus:
Sigh...

calamus:
Alula....
wanna help me look for some flowers for mom later?

alula:
YES

calamus:
...

calamus:
We're just about done here, so let us know when you want to go back to the ruins.

niko:
Okay.

niko:
Hey, do you know where I could find a battery?

calamus:
Good question..

calamus:
We... don't really use electricity in the Glen.

niko:
Ah.

calamus:
Oh, but there are robots at the research station!
If there's a battery anywhere, they'd know where it is.

niko:
Gotcha, thanks!

alula:
I hope she can see us wherever she is!

alula:
MOM YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED TODAY WE MET THE MESSIAH AND

alula:
...

alula:
...hi Niko!

niko:
Hi!

alula:
Didja find any.....any...

alula:
...what were you looking for again?

niko:
Gears?

alula:
Gears!
Didja find any of those?

niko:
No, but... I found this music box though!

alula:
Ooooh!

niko:
Do you know where I could find some gears?

alula:
Gears?
What's... that?

niko:
It's like... A metal circle thing with teeth!

alula:
A circle... with teeth?!

alula:
Haha, that sounds so silly!
Like something Magpie would have!

niko:
Magpie?

alula:
Y'know, the trader guy!

alula:
He collects all kinds of funny stuff!

alula:
I mean, he even keeps around broken glass and junk!

niko:
...

niko:
...Oh yeah!
I think I know who you're talking about.

alula:
He's such a weirdo!

cedric:
Looks like the flying machine has a chance after all!

cedric:
I just have to assemble the pieces now, but it might take a while...

cedric:
Do you mind keeping me company?

niko:
How's it going?

cedric:
Slow...

cedric:
The connectors in the battery were not designed for this type of engine, so I have to shift around some of these ports.

cedric:
...and there's this bolt that keeps getting stuck, and...

niko:
...ah.

cedric:
...don't worry! I am making decent progress!

cedric:
We should be able to make it to the city by tonight.

niko:
If you say so...

niko:
...

niko:
...what... will happen once we get there?

cedric:
We need to bring Proto back first.

cedric:
And then we need to go find one more person.

cedric:
You may have already met her, actually...

cedric:
Do you remember her from the last time you were in this world?

niko:
I...

niko:
...what does she... look like?

cedric:
This is going to sound strange, but...

cedric:
She is a fox.

niko:
...Rue?

cedric:
You've met?

niko:
I... think so...

niko:
The memories are still realy blurry, though...

niko:
...oh...

niko:
I.... DO remember talking to a fox at one point...

cedric:
You've met Rue?

niko:
The memories are still realy blurry, though...

cedric:
I see...

niko:
Oh, um...

niko:
I... don't think I know what you're talking about.

cedric:
Worth a shot.

cedric:
Rue can be... elusive.

cedric:
Even if she IS the least hidden one of us...

niko:
My memories are still realy blurry, though...

cedric:
I see...

niko:
....sigh.

niko:
It's just... hard... y'know?

niko:
Proto told me to think of this world like a dream.

niko:
But then I get so caught up with...

niko:
And I just...kinda... forget...

niko:
I forget that everything here is supposed to be...not real...

niko:
...and then... I remember.

niko:
...and then I just get really sad...

niko:
...I know this is for me to go home, but...

niko:
Knowing that none of it mattered in the first place...

niko:
...am I just trapped here for no reason...?

cedric:
...

niko:
Proto also told me to not ask anyone in the world about this...

niko:
Saying how "they don't understand"...

niko:
But... what about him?

niko:
How did HE know....?

cedric:
...

niko:
...How do YOU know?

niko:
Aren't you guys ALL supposed to be code?

cedric:
...well...

niko:
I'm not sure what to even believe anymore...

cedric:
...

cedric:
I wish Rue was here...

cedric:
She's SO much better at explaining this sort of thing.

cedric:
I'm doing a terrible job of it!

cedric:
I bet Proto was even less tactful, wasn't he...

cedric:
I'm afraid I must risk sounding callous, but...

cedric:
...please, you need not concern yourself with how "real" everything is, for now.

cedric:
The plan is already in motion, we cannot allow for distractions.

cedric:
Father is putting everything into this one last run of the world.

cedric:
The last chance for him to fix everything.

niko:
Your father... is involved in the World Machine?

cedric:
You... could say that.

cedric:
The acceleration of square particle anomalies was not accounted for at all, though.

cedric:
The patch was only built to accomodate the normal rate they appear, but...

cedric:
...they're accumulating at frightening speeds, now.

cedric:
Proto even lost his body...

cedric:
Thankfully, he gave you the disk just in time.

niko:
So... what happened to him anyway?

niko:
What happens to... ANYONE who gets caught in the squares?

niko:
I only know it's bad...

cedric:
Well, you know how the simulation works, right?

niko:
How everything...is code....?

cedric:
Specifically, everything is generated from pre-existing code.

cedric:
The squares can cause damage to that code...

cedric:
...most of the time, irreversible damage.

cedric:
Father has lost some friends in previous iterations of the simulation.

cedric:
It took him forever to develop the current, much more stable version.

niko:
...you're making it sound like... your dad built the simulation himself...

niko:
...wait, DID he?

cedric:
Yeah...

niko:
But... how?

niko:
If everyone in this world is code...

niko:
...how can he build...himself...?

cedric:
That's...um...

ot really what happened.

niko:
So... what happened?

cedric:
...like I said, you shouldn't concern yourself with...

niko:
...

cedric:
...with

niko:
.....

cedric:
...alright, alright....

cedric:
Did Prototype.... ever tell you about the old world?

niko:
...

niko:
He... DID say something about being built to greet the messiah of the old world.

niko:
I was um... too caught up with the other stuff at the time to think about it...

cedric:
Ah, you know OF it at least, then.

cedric:
Alright... here we go.

cedric:
My father... myself... the other two...

cedric:
None of us are part of the simulation itself.

cedric:
Our home world....the "real" world... was actually destroyed a long time ago.

niko:
...

cedric:
In the years leading up to the calamity, scientists from all over the world tried to stop it, but the outlook was bleak.

cedric:
A vague prophecy about a messiah from another world became everyone's last bastion of hope.

cedric:
Prophetbot....er, Prototype... was built to predict the future, about the specifics of this messiah.

cedric:
But as his predictions turned out, the messiah would not have been able to arrive to our world in time.

cedric:
In fact, the messiah would not even have been born before our world ended.

niko:
...

cedric:
Disheartened, most people abandoned their research and resolved to peacefully live out their final years.

cedric:
But... some people did the opposite.

cedric:
Even though saving the world was impossible, they didn't want our existence to be in vain.

cedric:
And that's... where my father came in.

cedric:
With the last of his resources...
he built his most ambitious project yet.

cedric:
..."The World Machine".

cedric:
A large, detailed facsimile of the old world, generated from a pool of memories collected from everyone he knew.

cedric:
...after a heavy amount of modification and an added narrative, my father was able to convert the entire structure into code.

niko:
...

niko:
...how did that code.... escape the old world?

cedric:
I have no idea.

cedric:
What I do know is, there is no equipment back home that was powerful enough to run the code independently.

cedric:
So, asides from the standard hardware, it also needed to borrow the mental processing abilities of a living person.

cedric:
Father used himself for that, during the initial testing phases.

cedric:
Like I said, it took many iterations for him to make the experience stable enough.

cedric:
...but as you can see, even that's breaking down.

niko:
Ah...

cedric:
Father caught on to the issue in the last minute, but did not have enough time to fix it.

cedric:
After the world ended... the code kinda just ended up...
floating in the void, indefinitely.

cedric:
...waiting for a willing operator to install it onto their own hardware.

niko:
...Player?

cedric:
Yeah.

cedric:
The operator... Player.... would then generate the universe using the code, becoming god in the process.

niko:
So... Player was the living person you needed to borrow?

cedric:
....No?

cedric:
That.... would be you.

niko:
But why me?

niko:
....

niko:
(I... should've asked that question a long time ago, shouldn't I...)

cedric:
I do not know.

cedric:
...we... really need to get going.

cedric:
Oh!!!

cedric:
It's you!

niko:
!

cedric:
You are Niko, correct?

niko:
Mhm!

cedric:
N-nice finally to meet you! ...no, wait.

cedric:
It is a pleasure to be of acquaintance at last, Niko.

cedric:
My name is Cedric.

niko:
Oh!

niko:
I'm supposed to be looking for you...

cedric:
I am aware.

cedric:
Proto had contacted me earlier, saying that you would be on your way to the city.

niko:
...Proto?

cedric:
Oh, sorry. Prototype.... Prophetbot 0...
Whatever you know him as.

cedric:
He sent me a message after his memories were restored.

niko:
Oh...

cedric:
He told me to wait for you in the city, but I thought it'd be faster for me to transport you directly.

cedric:
...Turns out, that was not a smart move.

niko:
Transport... directly?

niko:
...wait...

niko:
YOU can fly that airplane??

cedric:
...air...plane?
I have no idea what that is.

niko:
That thing behind you!

cedric:
Oh!
You mean the flying machine?

niko:
I...guess you can call it that.

niko:
They're called airplanes in my world, though!

cedric:
Oh...

cedric:
...I did not realize they existed in other worlds...

niko:
...wait a minute! are you the friend that Calamus and Alula was talking about, then?

niko:
Is this the same flying machine they were talking about?

cedric:
Ah, I do not know anyone named Calamus or Alula.

cedric:
But... if they have memories of the flying machine...

cedric:
Then they are meant to be friends with my father.
..in the previous iterations of the...

cedric:
Father WAS the original owner of the machine, after all...

cedric:
...it's... one of his greatest inventions, actually.

niko:
YOUR DAD INVENTED AIRPLANES???

cedric:
It's a flying machine!

niko:
IT'S COOL EITHER WAY!!

cedric:
Thanks?

cedric:
...

cedric:
...to answer your earlier question, yes.
I am indeed proficient in operating this machine.

cedric:
...but...something weird happened to the engine when I was in the air earlier...

cedric:
I had to make an emergency landing on this tiny island before I crashed into the city wall.

niko:
Your almonst crashed?
That's terrible!

cedric:
It was not pleasant, I will admit.


cedric:
Wonder if the engine problem has to do with the square particle disruptions...

cedric:
There wasn't any of that stuff stuff inside the machine itself, but...

cedric:
...I noticed some islands in the Glen are REALLY messed up now.

niko:
Looks like it...

cedric:
Sigh.
Guess I should have listened to Proto in the first place.

cedric:
...say, where is he?

cedric:
He said he was coming with you...

cedric:
Is he still back at the main islands?

niko:
Oh... actually...

No!!

niko:
He... did give me this, though.

niko:
This disk he pulled from his head...

cedric:
Oh!!!

cedric:
Let's see...

cedric:
Oh thank goodness.

cedric:
He gave you his main drive...

cedric:
As long as I have this, I should be able to bring him back.

niko:
R-really?

cedric:
It's gonna be hard, but yes.

cedric:
You need all three of us to find the ending.

niko:
The...?

cedric:
But first thing's first, we need to find a way to go to the city.

niko:
Right...
The city gate is kind of kaput now.

cedric:
If only there was a way for me to fix the flying machine...

cedric:
I've isolated the issue with the machine, but I can't repair it with the stuff I have on hand.

niko:
Oh? What's wrong with it?

cedric:
The c[2]batteryc[0] in the engine basically imploded, and the rest of the engine has some c[2]gearsc[0] missing.

niko:
...
Do you think you'll be able to fix it if Player and I helped you find those things?

cedric:
...maybe.

cedric:
Problem is... the Glen isn't exactly a very high-tech area.

cedric:
...I'm not sure if you'll be able to find anything so specialized here.

niko:
We'll try anyway!

niko:
We can't really do anything else right now...

niko:
It's a plane!

cedric:
...flying machine!

niko:
Right.

niko:
It's a tent.

niko:
Just a wrench.

niko:
It's a crowbar.

niko:
Looks like a piece from this plane.

niko:
It's a fire.

niko:
We made it!

calamus:
C'mon, Alula.
Let's go see mom.

alula:
Okay!

calamus:
This is her grave...

calamus:
We're just about done here, so let us know when you want to go back to the ruins.

niko:
Okay.

niko:
Hey, do you know where I could find a battery?

calamus:
Good question..

calamus:
We... don't really use electricity in the Glen.

niko:
Ah.

calamus:
Oh, but there are robots at the research station!
If there's a battery anywhere, they'd know where it is.

niko:
Gotcha, thanks!

alula:
Hi mom...

alula:
Didja find any.....any...

alula:
...what were you looking for again?

niko:
Gears?

alula:
Gears!Didja find any of those?

niko:
No, but... I found this music box though!

alula:
Ooooh!

niko:
Do you know where I could find some gears?

alula:
Gears?
What's... that?

niko:
It's like... A metal circle thing with teeth!

alula:
A circle... with teeth?!

alula:
Haha, that sounds so silly!
Like something Magpie would have!

niko:
Magpie?

alula:
Y'know, the trader guy!

alula:
He collects all kinds of funny stuff!

alula:
I mean, he even keeps around broken glass and junk!

niko:
...

niko:
...Oh yeah! think I know who you're talking about.

alula:
He's such a weirdo!

cedric:
...it's fixed.

cedric:
We can leave in the next five minutes, if you are ready.

niko:
...alright.

niko:
...

cedric:
I understand if you are upset.

cedric:
But please... try to understand.

cedric:
My father is doing this to help all of us.

cedric:
And that includes you, Niko.

cedric:
The fact that you can't even go back home... I'm sure it upsets him greatly.

cedric:
It's...

cedric:
Sigh...

cedric:
The world means a lot to him, you know...

niko:
So... how does flying... work?

cedric:
...wait, don't these machines already exist in your world?
You should already know what to expect...

niko:
Not really...

niko:
I've only heard about them!

niko:
They're usually... a lot bigger than this one, anyway.

cedric:
Ah...

cedric:
Well, a word of precaution, before we take to the air...

cedric:
Please try not to panic.

cedric:
It takes a few minutes of getting used to, but it's not that bad once you are in the air.

niko:
I'll... try.

niko:
Oh! I should probably tell Calamus and Alula where I'm going.

cedric:
You mean those two running over here now?

alula:
Niko!!!!

alula:
Bad news!

calamus:
The boat is gone!

niko:
What?!

alula:
It's the squares!

calamus:
It looks like they're headed in this direction!

niko:
That's...

cedric:
...fast...

cedric:
...Calamus, right?

calamus:
Yeah?

cedric:
How... bad, is it?

calamus:
Doesn't seem to be of immediate danger.

cedric:
Then... it is of priority that I take you to the city first, Niko

niko:
But what about them...?

cedric:
I can make a detour later and drop you guys off in the city too, if you want.

cedric:
The city is better equipped to handle the squares, you'll be safer there.

alula:
YOU'RE TAKING US TO THE CITY!!!

cedric:
If you wish.

alula:
OH YEAH!!!

cedric:
Alright.

cedric:
I will be back here in an hour, so please wait for me until then.

niko:
You guys sure you'll be fine here?

alula:
Mhm!

calamus:
The squares are still moving pretty slowly for now...

niko:
Alright, then...

niko:
Guess we'll run into each other again, soon...

niko:
I'm ready to go!

cedric:
Alright!

niko:
Do you know where I could find a battery for a flying machine?

unknown:
[I HAVE A BATTERY INTEGRATED INTO MY SYSTEM.]

unknown:
[IT CANNOT BE USED TO POWER OTHER THINGS.]

niko:
Ah...

unknown:
[STAY SAFE.]

niko:
You too!

unknown:
[HELLO, PERSON.]

unknown:
[THE RESEARCH STATION IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.]

niko:
I can tell...

niko:
Even the bridge on the way here was...

unknown:
[ARE YOU SENT HERE BY DR. SILVERPOINT?]

niko:
...no?

unknown:
[OH, CARRY ON, THEN.]

niko:
By the way, do you know where I could find a battery for a flying machine?

unknown:
[I DO NOT.]

niko:
Alright...

unknown:
[ANOMALIES ARE INCREASING...]

niko:
Do you know where I could find a battery for a flying machine?

unknown:
[HAVE YOU CHECKED THE POWER ROOM?]

niko:
Would you happen to know where I can find a battery for a flying machine?

unknown:
[WHAT IS A FLYING MACHINE.]

niko:
Nevermind.

unknown:
[SOME VINES JUST GREW AROUND THIS BRIDGE.]

unknown:
[ALMOST AS IF IT WAS AN INTENTIONAL REPAIR EFFORT.]

niko:
Yeah...

unknown:
[DO WHAT YOU MUST.]

unknown:
[HELLO, PERSON.]

unknown:
[THIS IS THE MAIN GENERATOR OF THE GLEN.]

niko:
Hello...

niko:
Would you happen to know where I can find a battery for a flying machine?

niko:
It's... kind of an emergency.

unknown:
[I DO NOT KNOW WHAT A FLYING MACHINE IS.]

unknown:
[BUT ANY SORT OF LARGE MACHINERY WOULD REQUIRE A HIGH CAPACITY POWER CELL.]

unknown:
[FOR EXAMPLE, THE GENERATOR IN THIS ROOM UTILIZES SUCH A DEVICE.]

niko:
Oh right... I almost forgot...

niko:
We had to fix the battery for this thing in the Barrens, didn't we, Player?

unknown:
[IF THIS IS AN EMERGENCY FOR LIVING BEINGS...]
[YOU CAN USE THE BATTERY FROM THE GENERATOR.]

niko:
Oh!

niko:
Wait... but if we take the battery here...

niko:
...all of you guys would lose power, wouldn't you?

niko:
Maybe Player and I should go find another one.

unknown:
[NEGATIVE.]

unknown:
[THIS IS THE ONLY BATTERY IN THE GLEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO BE USED AS A STANDALONE UNIT.]

unknown:
[IF IT IS A DIRE SITUATION, THEN DO WHAT YOU MUST.]

niko:
Oh...

niko:
...we depowered it...

niko:
...I guess we have no choice but to take this, Player...

niko:
...

niko:
Looks like a generator...

unknown:
[PLEASE DO NOT STAND TOO CLOSE TO THE GENERATOR.]

unknown:
[IF YOU HAVE INQUIRIES, PLEASE ASK ME INSTEAD.]

niko:
The battery's gone now...

niko:
We should remember to bring it back once we're done with it!

niko:
A couple of fireflies are buzzing about in this jar.

unknown:
My mommy is making food for everyone!

unknown:
I want to help her catch fish, but I'm not a grownup yet!

niko:
The horizon is glowing blue.

magpie:
By the way... if you ever see a big guy with goggles and a cool helmet..

magpie:
Tell him the trader in the Glen said hi!

magpie:
Also ask him if he has any more music boxes for trading.

niko:
Will do!

niko:
Oh! You're the trader guy!

magpie:
Sure am!
You here to trade?

magpie:
'Cause if you are, then I got bad news for ya.

magpie:
A lot of my stuff is back at my cart, which was sadly abandoned when I was running for my life.

magpie:
So my collection is... very limited right now.

magpie:
Managed to grab some of my favorite things before I left, though!

niko:
Oh! Uh...

niko:
Do you have anything like... gears?

magpie:
Gears? Like... the metal spinny things? I don't think I have anything like that...

magpie:
Wait.

magpie:
I do have this box thing that you can wind up and play a song.

niko:
That's a music box!

magpie:
Yeah!
I bet there's lots of little metal bits in there!

niko:
Oh! That might work!

magpie:
But I'm not sure if I want to trade it away...
It's one of my favorite things!

niko:
Aw...

magpie:
...

magpie:
Oh, what am I saying!
You're the savior!

magpie:
Things have been getting bad around here lately.

magpie:
If I don't help you, I might not even be around much longer...

magpie:
You need this to save the world, right?
Take it.

niko:
Ah! Thank you!

unknown:
Hm...

unknown:
Nothing's biting...

unknown:
Hi I'm an inaccessible npc.

niko:
A few small fish are in the bottom of this jar.

niko:
These are filled with small, dried fish.

niko:
It's full of fish heads!

niko:
Filled with small, dried fish.

niko:
These look like crab shells.

unknown:
*sniff*

niko:
Are you okay?

unknown:
I WANNA GO BACK HOME!!!

unknown:
This island has more moss covering than our village did.

unknown:
Would've been nice to build a settlement here.

unknown:
...too late now, I guess.

unknown:
The land fragmentation is happening faster and faster now...

unknown:
But... looks like the vines are slowing it down...

unknown:
Our village was ransacked by the squares not long ago...

unknown:
Most of us made it out alive, but we can't really go back anymore.

niko:
Oh...

unknown:
Squares are bad news, man.

unknown:
Sigh...

unknown:
We won't last long now, will we?

unknown:
The sun can't fix the squares...

unknown:
The sun can't restore the land...

unknown:
The vines are everywhere!

unknown:
The plant lady must be protecting us!

niko:
...yeah...

shepherd:
What a day...

unknown:
Looks like the Glen is deteriorating faster than ever, now...

niko:
An empty jar.

niko:
A jar of worms.

niko:
Gross!

niko:
These are filled with small, dried fish.

niko:
It's a fish stew!

niko:
At least... I think it's fish!

niko:
They look kinda like snakes...

niko:
It's a fish stew!

niko:
A fishing pole.

alula:
My brother knows how to fish too!

alula:
But I don't!

niko:
Same!

A fishing pole.

Oh, hello, messiah.

Would you like some stew?

unknown:
I made enough to feed a whole village!

...literally!

niko:
It's ok, thanks!

unknown:
[WATER SAMPLE COLLECTION IN PROGRESS...]

niko:
Oh no!
The bridge is out!

niko:
There sure are a lot of vines growing around here now though...

calamus:
Alula?
Alula? Where did you go?

niko:
Player, did you hear that?

calamus:
Alula!

niko:
I think it's coming from south-east of here.

unknown:
[WATER SAMPLE COLLECTION IN PROGRESS...]

unknown:
The bridge to the forest was just restored...

unknown:
The village evacuees should be able to find better fishing spots here.

unknown:
The plant spirit is really looking out for us, isn't she?

niko:
...yeah.

unknown:
This plane doesn't have a runway because night said so that's why. -GIR

cedric:
...phew.

cedric:
Made it!

niko:
...

cedric:
You...okay, there?

niko:
...That was the coolest thing I have ever done in my entire life.

cedric:
Heheh... reactions from first-timers are always delightful to watch.

niko:
...

niko:
...

niko:
Hey, Player?

niko:
That... was really fun.

niko:
Did you... have fun too?

niko:
I mean... you weren't on the plane with me, but...

niko:
You got to watch it at least, right?

niko:
And... Cedric...?

cedric:
Yeah?

niko:
Thanks...

cedric:
....What for?

niko:
Flying!

cedric:
Oh, um...

cedric:
You're... welcome?

niko:
And... for answering my questions back there, too...

niko:
And... for telling me more about the World Machine.

niko:
I'm just.... really sorry about what happened to your old world, though...

niko:
So... I'll help you the best that I can.

cedric:
...

niko:
And... even if it's all just a machine, this world is still...
ice...

niko:
I mean, I got to fly... I got to see the ocean...

niko:
And...I got to meet a lot of nice people!
People like you!

niko:
...and Prototype, even if he's broken right now.

cedric:
...I'm glad you are taking it so well, Niko.

cedric:
And... I'm glad that we have met as well.

cedric:
...Despite the... circumstances.

cedric:
Ah, speaking of Proto... I should probably head off now.

cedric:
I need to go pick up the siblings too...

niko:
That's true... those two have been waiting for a while now...

cedric:
In the meantime...

cedric:
Do you remember what to do to get to the surface?

niko:
I remember having to fix an elevator button!

cedric:
Alright, you should attend to that, then.

cedric:
Let's meet up here in an hour, okay?

niko:
Got it!

cedric:
Alright, now lemme just-

cedric:
...

niko:
No!

cedric:
...

niko:
...they're... trapped on the island...

niko:
...

niko:
......Calamus....Alula....

niko:
...they're ....

cedric:
...

cedric:
....we...don't have much time left.

cedric:
Niko... change of plans.

cedric:
Please give me the memory disk.

niko:
...alright...

cedric:
Listen carefully.

cedric:
It's likely I'll be targeted again, so we should split up to keep you safe.

cedric:
I want you to find a door under a large clock.

cedric:
The room behind it houses a pair of ground access elevators.

cedric:
Once you get to the ground, immediately find Rue and bring her back to the room.

cedric:
She will know what to do in the meantime.

niko:
Alright...What about you, though?

cedric:
I'm going to bring Prototype back.

niko:
WH-

niko:
Are you okay???

cedric:
WHAAAAAT????

niko:
ARE YOU OKAAAAAY???

cedric:
DON'T WORRYYY I'M FINEEEE

Y'know... from the west apartments.

The square stuff wrecked the place yesterday...

niko:
Oh....

Right now everyone's crowded in the cafe.
We really want to get everyone to the surface as soon as possible, though.

The library on the surface doubles as a shelter for situations like this.

niko:
I see...

niko:
...wait... didn't we find the magnets and stuff in the apartments, Player?

The... what?

niko:
Looks like we'll have to find some other way to fix the button, Player...

plight:
HOLY FUDGE

niko:

But... this is the only elevator in the area...

We'll... think of something.

Let me know if you need my help with anything...

I've literally never seen another one in this area!

It WAS in a locked room...

Oh....

Do they... uh... work?

We don't know yet...

One of them has a lever that's out of my reach.

...wait! You can help us!

What...

niko:
You should be able to reach the lever, cuz...
You're taller than me!

Ooh... I... guess I am?

So... show me the way, I suppose...

Mhm!

The screen is off.

A heavy piece of metal set into the wall.

niko:
I think it might be a door or some kind of vault.

niko:
There's a small screen here, in the middle.

niko:
The door is locked.

niko:
Looks like it's asking for a password.

niko:
The word "DOCUMENTS" is on the screen, above the password prompt.

niko:
That wasn't it...

niko:
A heavy piece of metal set into the wall.

niko:
Looks like a door of some sort!

niko:
There's a glowing lock symbol on a small screen.

niko:
A row of glass tubes are set into the wall.

niko:
They're high up!

niko:
This looks like a countdown of some sort.
All the tubes say "0".

niko:
...I guess it finished counting down to...whatever it was counting down to?
Or maybe it's just broken.

You'd think the door would be open, yet...

You guys are... okay?

Yup!

cedric:
When the factory started collapsing, I really thought we didn't have a chance...

...Fortunately, the robot assembly rooms were built pretty tough.

And... it actually did not take me long to bring Proto back.

cedric:
...all thanks to father's book!

[He had made my design documents to be compatible with the assembly machines there.]

cedric:
All I had to do was scan in the blueprints and reconfigure some machine settings!

That he does!

I'm... just glad everyone is ok.

This one is red.

This one would be meant for me, then.

Hello.

This one is red.

A portal with a red glow.

The squares are here too now...

niko:
This elevator won't open.

niko:
Looks like it's stuck on another floor?

niko:
There's squares here too, now...

niko:
We need to find a way to reach that lever up there.

niko:
We might need a grownup for this...

niko:
This elevator has no button panel.

Tapping the door doesn't open it either, hmm...

niko:
That usually works...

niko:
Wait...

There's a lever hanging from the ceiling!

Prototype? Cedric?

He was in the lab complex when it collapsed...

No...

Come on, let's go upstairs.

cedric:
Oh... this is...

proto:
[...no wonder he wanted us to all be here for this.]

niko:
Um... what are these things, anyway?

proto:
[Code portals.]

proto:
[They... temporarily remove us from the world.]

niko:
....what?

cedric:
It's... a bit hard to explain...

cedric:
But... basically, my father has hidden a decryption key in our code, with a .txt file as its shell...

proto:
[...But to get to them, we have to be removed from the world and decompiled.]

proto:
[...When our keys are combined into a central location, it will activate an encrypted part of this world, which will...]

niko:
*confused cat noises*

proto:
[...]

proto:
[...Rue, maybe it's better if you explain.]

rue:
I'll attempt.

rue:
Basically... these portals all represent a physical location on Player's machine.

niko:
...oooh.

rue:
And... when we enter these portals, we will be sent to that location...

proto:
[...Wherever that is.]

rue:
I'm... sure Player is already pretty familiar with retrieving puzzle pieces from this world on their computer.

rue:
...But this time, Player would need to move around some things, as well.

cedric:
...specifically, by moving the keys from the small portal to the big one.

cedric:
I... don't know what happens next, though.

niko:
I see...

niko:
Does Player know where these portals lead, at least?

rue:
You should probably ask Player on this...

niko:
Right.

niko:
...Hold on.

niko:
The journal is glowing again, Player...

plight:
...This room gives me the creeps, man...

Oh, same!

So um... what did you need help with again?

Can you reach the lever up there?

plight:
Oh, right...

plight:
Wait...

...I'm not THAT tall!

niko:
(Well it was worth a shot.)

Nice!

niko:
Thank you, mister!

plight:
No prob, kid.

So... you coming?

niko:
Mhm!

niko:
The lever won't do much for us now, Player...

niko:
There's a lever hanging from the ceiling...

niko:
We should find someone tall to reach it for us, Player!

rue:
You know... This is the tallest building in the refuge.

rue:
It's... my favorite place in this world.

rue:
I liked to look at the far-off buildings and imagine...what kind of lives that might be behind each of the windows.

niko:

rue:
...Can you... lift me onto the banister?

rue:
I want to get a better look.

It was depressing for me at first too, you know...

Knowing that all of this is... well...

niko:

rue:
Simulated.

Did he?

I'm... really sorry about that... I can't imagine...how you must feel...

rue:
The feeling of never being able to go home again...?

rue:
That's... probably not all that different from your plight, is it?

rue:
...

rue:
...it really IS ironic.

rue:
You are prevented from going home by the same...individual... who never wanted to bring you here.

niko:
...Huh? Who would that be?

rue:
The World Machine.

rue:
You... might know it as the Entity.

niko:
Oh...

niko:
"The Entity"... DOES sound familiar.

niko:
I think I heard it from the dice lady, from another time.

niko:
Was it... the spirit of the world?

rue:
Yes!

rue:
....

rue:
...But... thing is...
The World Machine was only built to run on the mental abilities of someone else.

rue:
It was never meant to develop a mind of its own.

niko:
...

rue:
It was an oversight.

rue:
My creator specialized in artificial intelligence for so long...
It was simply ingrained in his work.

rue:
...sigh.

rue:
And... all machines are built with a fundamental law. "Never let a living being come to harm".

rue:
From the World Machine's perspective, it has to violate its deepest, most foundational instinct.

rue:
It has to put a living person in danger.

rue:
It has to bring a real person into a dying world that isn't even real.

niko:
...

rue:
...Of course, the simulation never contained any real danger.

rue:
The eventual, intended ending was meant to be a happy one.

rue:
...but the World Machine doesn't know that.

niko:
...really?

rue:
Unfortunately...

rue:
Sentient machines tend to handle conflicts in their code very badly.

rue:
This central conflict triggered a self- destructive downward spiral.

rue:
You can see physical manifestations of that everywhere, now...

niko:
The squares...

rue:
That's the World Machine corrupting its own code.

rue:
...My creator says it's largely an involuntary process, induced by stress and the desire to self- terminate.

niko:
Your creator knows?

niko:
Sounds like this has been going on since the beginning, then...

rue:
Yeah.

rue:
The disruption was an issue during test runs, even.

rue:
At first, my creator thought the instability was due to the sheer scope of the project.

rue:
He spent most of his remaining time testing it over and over again, scaling down the story, reiterating the narrative...

rue:
...by the time he realized the actual root of the problem, our home world's remaining lifespan was measured in mere days.

niko:
...Oh.

niko:
...is there.... any way for us to...

rue:
...fix the World Machine?
We tried.

rue:
The World Machine doesn't believe any of the world's residents are real.

rue:
...myself included.

rue:
The odds are against us... we have no chance of taming it.

niko:
Taming?

niko:
I have heard that word SO many times!

niko:
I only know it's complicated
..and that it has to do with robots, but...

niko:
...for once, I want to know what it really means.

rue:
...that's what I'm here for.

rue:
Do you... know what a robot is?

niko:
Yeah?

rue:
No, I mean.
Do you KNOW what a robot is?

niko:
...um.

rue:
A robot is not a real person, is it?

niko:
...right.

rue:
It's a being whose entire existence is code.

rue:
Inflexible programming, with thoughts dictated by someone else's design.

rue:
They can be copied, they can be mass produced, then can be assigned all sorts of jobs.

rue:
...And most importantly... they will never confuse themselves with the living.

rue:
They will always be bound by their code, the knowledge that they are a robot.

rue:
...but this was more of a limitation than anything else.

niko:
Ah, that makes sense.

niko:
You can't... really build a robot to not follow its own code, can you?

rue:
People have tried, but it's a recipe for disaster.

rue:
In a way, that's what happened to The World Machine.

niko:
The... code conflicts thing?

rue:
Yeah.

rue:
But, while you can't BUILD a robot to not follow its code...

rue:
You can establish a special bond with it.

rue:
If the strength of that bond is strong enough...

rue:
...the robot's mental capacity will start to develop outside of its programming.

rue:
In a way, it's starting to believe itself as a "real", valid individual.

niko:
...

rue:
It's a complete suspension of disbelief on your end, though.

rue:
You have to fully embrace the robot as a genuine, living person, even knowing they are not...

rue:
You need to spend a lot time with it... treat it like a good friend...

rue:
Devoting your heart to the robot until it is able to return your feelings.

rue:
...haha... I make it sound so easy, don't I?

rue:
But you and Player know better than anyone that it's not.

rue:
Right now, the World Machine is probably really, really scared.

rue:
This content update... involved some pretty deep codework.

rue:
My creator was able to access some of the source code, you know...

rue:
He did what he could and established new connections between maps.

rue:
Those links enabled you to meet the other two.

rue:
But as it turns out, the new code confused the World Machine to such an extent that it's breaking down altogether.

rue:
Even though the World Machine always had self-destructive tendencies, it usually restrains itself when you are in the world.

rue:
It doesn't want to take you along with it.

niko:
...

rue:
...All my creator wanted was to write a happy ending.

rue:
Right now, the only hope of saving you is to take you through that ending.

rue:
But now the other two are gone....
I don't even know HOW we're gonna get you there.

rue:
...

rue:
...we should go.

rue:
Even this place is no longer safe.

Black clovers are so resilient...I wonder how they do it?

It's really a shame that the Glen is starting to erode so fast now...

Soon, the world won't have much room for plants left...

Bummer!

I had to leave most of my plants behind.

This stinks!

Sorry to hear...

mason:
Oh, speaking of plants...

mason:
I heard the Glen is just COVERED in vines now.

mason:
Is that true?

niko:
...yeah...

niko:
The plant lady was using them to keep the land from falling away...

mason:
The plant spirit? Maize?

H-hold on! Maybe Player and I can...

No, no, it's okay!

Good thinking, Player. It's a good idea to have a backup.

It's another photo of me...

Three is enough, right?

niko:
It's another photo of me...

How many of these do we need, Player?

niko:
It's a photo of me...

niko:
And the camera is out of film now...

niko:
There's a slot here.
Looks like paper or something might come out from it.

niko:
It's out of film...

niko:
...
I guess that wasn't the right combination, Player.

niko:
...
It didn't do anything.

niko:
The squares are here too...

niko:
Hey, Player?

Do you remember where the cafe is?

Oh...

Wait! I think I remember!
It's up the elevator, and then we take a right and go down some stairs!

I'm asking because...well...

niko:
I'm... a little hungry....

Actually I'm REALLY hungry!
I haven't eaten anything since I got here...

So...is it ok if we go get some food before we enter the Tower?

niko:
I hope they have pancakes...

niko:
Um...

niko:
What...are you doing...to that book?

unknown:
Editing it!!!

unknown:
I've been in the Author's shadow for my entire career.

unknown:
If I'm gonna die soon, I wanna die knowing I put out at least ONE original idea out there!

unknown:
Despite all this... I still really wish I could've met the Author...

niko:
Oh! Um...

niko:
What book did Cedric take?

george:
"The Creation of Prophetbot", one of the Author's greatest works in my opinion.

george:
It's filled to the brim with intricate illustrations and blueprints...
Lots of attention to detail, for sure.

george:
George rates it 10 out of 10.

niko:
Ooh...

niko:
Oh! Um...

niko:
What book did Cedric take?

george:
One of my favorites, thank you very much...

george:
...it's the Author's book detailing the creation of Prophetbot.

george:
And by "detailing", I mean it!
There's a TON of detail in that book.

george:
Blueprints, progress shots...

george:
Took me forever to edit...

niko:
Ooh...

unknown:


niko:
Oh! Um...

niko:
What book did Cedric take?

george:
...the Author's book on the creation of Prophetbot...

george:
...you know... the first robot you met in our world...

niko:
Yeah.

george:
...oh...The book was quite detailed, too....

george:
It... would've been useful to your friend, I think...

niko:
...yeah.

niko:
Oh! Um...

niko:
What book did Cedric take?

george:
The Author's book on the creation of Prophetbot!

george:
Remember Prophetbot? The first robot you met in our world?

niko:
Yeah...

george:
He's a work of art!!!

george:
The Author's book was so detailed... really made me appreciate how much work went into him!

niko:
Ooh...

niko:
Oh! Um...

niko:
What book did Cedric take?

george:
"The Creation of Prophetbot", dear.
It's one of my favorite books by the Author!

george:
The book contains many detailed blueprints and progress shots.

george:
I really enjoyed editing it!

niko:
Ooh...

niko:
Oh! Um...

niko:
What book did Cedric take?

george:
You remember Prophetbot?
The first robot you met in our world?

niko:
...yeah?

george:
The Author wrote a book on how he was made!
It's one of his best works, bruh.

george:
You just gotta love that guy's attention to detail... all the little parts that just came together...

george:
...was the freshest book I've ever edited, man!

Sure gave me a good scare back there!

kip:
Sorry, George...

george:
Whoaa! You found the messiah too?

george:
Sweeet.

george:
How's it goin', lil fella?

niko:
Bad.

george:
Oh same.

kip:
...we, um.

kip:
...we ran into each other after this boy forced himself into the lab complex...

kip:
I...couldn't stop him...

kip:
I don't know why he was being so insistent!

niko:
He... he said he needed to go rebuild a robot...

kip:
Oh, you know him?

niko:
Yeah.

george:
AHA! Building a robot!

george:
So THAT's what he needed that book for!

niko:
...come again?

george:
A boy with white hair and goggles ran in here not long ago.

niko:
That's Cedric, yeah...

george:
He grabbed one of the books from my (very impressive) archives upstairs and bolted straight out.

george:
Said it was an emergency so George let it slide.

george:
George hopes he's okay...

george:
Robot...

george:
That's why he needed that book so badly...

george:
Y'all talking about a kid with white hair and goggles?

niko:
That's Cedric, yeah...

george:
He ran in here earlier, grabbed one of the books from my archives, and ran straight out the door.

george:
...without even going through checkout!

george:
THE NERVE OF THAT KID!

niko:
Um...

george:
Said it was an emergency, so I didn't bother stopping him.

george:
I...hope he doesn't get himself killed out there.

george:
...robot...

george:
Are you talking about... a boy with white hair and googles?

niko:
That's Cedric, yeah...

george:
He...

george:
He said he really needed a book from the backroom and said it was an emergency and I let him have it and he ran out and...

george:
Oh.... I should have stopped him....

george:
I hope he's...okay...

george:
A robot!

george:
...no wonder why he needed that book!

niko:
...come again?

george:
We are talking about the same boy, right?

george:
Hat... white hair... goggles...

niko:
That's Cedric, yeah...

george:
He, um...

george:
He grabbed a book from the back room and then just bolted straight out!

george:
He said it was an emergency, so I didn't try to stop him...

george:
Gosh... I hope he's okay...

george:
Building a robot, you say?

george:
Could that be... why he needed that book?

niko:
...come again?

george:
Ah... a young man with white hair and green glasses ran in earlier.

niko:
That's Cedric, yeah...

george:
He said he really needed a book from the backroom... said it was an emergency, too!

george:
Poor darling looked so stressed out... so I just gave him the book...

george:
I hope he is safe...

george:
Robot, eh?

george:
Y'all talkin' about a lil' dude with white hair and goggles, right?

niko:
That's Cedric, yeah...

george:
Bruh ran off with one of my books!

george:
Said it was an emergency, so I just let 'im have it.

george:
Hope he didn't run into trouble, dude...

kip:
Yeah... I hope he's alright, too...

kip:
With any luck, maybe the lab complex can hold up long enough for him to...

kip:
Oh my gosh.... It...

kip:
That was...

niko:
...the labs?

kip:
That poor kid!!!

niko:
No!!!

niko:
Not him too!!!!

kip:
I'm...

kip:
I'm sorry about your friend...

niko:
...

niko:
...the last time we spoke, he told me to go look for someone on the surface.

niko:
I... I need to get going.

george:
George... WON'T let you go out there!

george:
The messiah will not walk into danger on my watch!

niko:
But...

george:
Are you KIDDING ME??

george:
Kid, there is NO way we're letting you out there.

niko:
But I really have to...

george:
Um...um...

george:
You... shouldn't go out there....!

niko:
But...

george:
Oh.... help me out here, Kip....

george:
...messiah, please.

george:
We don't...want you to go out there.

george:
Not when everything is... well...

george:
Sweetie, you know we can't let you just walk into danger!

niko:
But...

george:
Bruh...
You know we ain't gonna let you walk into the fire like that!

george:
Fire... squares...

niko:
But...

kip:
George is right...

kip:
The squares seem to be targeting a lot of the weaker constructs in the city.

kip:
Only the library has enough structural integrity to withstand collapse...

kip:
It's... best if you stayed here until things stabilize.

kip:
...however long that takes.

niko:
But....but...

niko:
What about... my mission?

niko:
Don't you guys want me to bring the sun back, at least?

george:
Even if you do restore the sun, the squares will persist...

george:
The sun won't do us any good if the squares are just gonna mess everything up.

george:
Oh...but even if you do bring the sun back...

george:
...the squares... they'll still be here...

george:
Even if you do bring back the sun, that's not gonna fix the squares...

george:
Even if you do restore the sun, I'm not sure that'll fix the squares...

george:
...sun ain't gonna make the squares go away, dude.

kip:
Sadly...

kip:
Not to mention... even getting there is going to be hard...

kip:
If the world is like this... there's no telling what's going on in the Tower!

george:
And... if anything bad happened to the messiah, of all people...

george:
...George doesn't want to think about it.

george:
And... if anything bad happened to the messiah, of all people...

george:
...NO!!! I won't allow it!!!

george:
And... if anything bad happened to the messiah, of all people...

george:
I'm not sure if I'll be able forgive myself...

george:
And... if anything bad happened to the messiah, of all people...

george:
I'm not sure what we'd do!

george:
And... if anything bad happened to the messiah, of all people...

george:
Oh... that would be so dreadful, dear...

george:
And... if the messiah got hurt, of all people...

george:
That's like...the exact opposite of radical, dude....

kip:
Sigh...

kip:
A friend of mine... said something about this forever ago...

kip:
"It's better for the world to die naturally."

kip:
"No living being should have to carry that burden."

kip:
At the time... I thought it was still her faulty code speaking...

kip:
But now I... I'm starting to understand...

niko:
...

kip:
Messiah... I'm sorry...

kip:
I'm really, really sorry....

kip:
All this time, we've burdened you with our hope, our faith...

kip:
...blissfully ignoring the fact that you are just a lost child.

niko:
Well...

kip:
You're probably more scared than any of us, aren't you?

kip:
We... have been dealing with tragedy for so long, it's become background noise to us now.

kip:
But for you... it must be so terrifying...

kip:
And now, you're stuck here with the rest of us...

kip:
...being held back by the very people you were told to save.

kip:
We must seem so ungrateful...

niko:
...

niko:
.....It's.......okay.

kip:
...

niko:
I...

niko:
...when I first came to this world... a long time ago....

niko:
...back then, all I wanted was to go home.

kip:
...

niko:
...Player... do you remember?

niko:
The very FIRST time...

niko:
I'm not sure how far back it was for you...

niko:
But... I remember towards the end...
I... actually wasn't sure anymore.

niko:
...about going home.

niko:
Even knowing the world would be doomed eventually...

niko:
I... still wanted the people here to be happy...

niko:
So... when you told me to return the sun, back then...

niko:
I didn't even.... question it...

niko:
So... when you told me to return home, back then...

niko:
I wasn't... sure...

niko:
But I trusted you more, Player...

niko:
...but then I just... came back.

kip:
You... what...

niko:
I...

niko:
And I... went through that decision again, didn't I?

niko:
But... I came back again...

niko:
Even though you were able to do both... the effects couldn't be permanent, could it?

niko:
And then... I found out about the world being like this...

niko:
Sigh...

niko:
Prototype said to forget the things he told me...
And Cedric told me not to think about it too much, but...

niko:
I...

niko:
I'm sorry for getting upset at you... back at the mines...

niko:
...I thought... for you to know all that, yet continue doing this...

niko:
It... just seemed cruel.

niko:
But then, I realized something...

niko:
You... really wanted to save both the world and me...

niko:
But at the end, you can only choose one, right?

niko:
Is it... really hard for you too?

niko:
It must be...

niko:
...

niko:
...if the world isn't broken...will that choice still be there?

niko:
...do you... still need to choose between one or the other?

niko:
But... even if it is...

niko:
I... really want to save this world, Player.

niko:
Even if it's more dangerous this time around...

niko:
Even if... so many of the nice people we met were.... were...

niko:
......

niko:
Player....
I'm not.... afraid, anymore....

niko:
*sniff*

niko:
That's why...
I think you guys should let me go...

niko:
I... promise I'll be okay...

niko:
...please?

kip:
...

george:
...

george:
George has heard your conversation with Player and is deeply moved!

george:
That's why... George has full faith in you!

george:
...well, I'm convinced.

george:
After all that... it'd be SUPER rude for me to stop you, wouldn't it?

george:
...if you must...

george:
It... wouldn't be right for me to keep you...

george:
Ohhhh.....
That was BEAUTIFUL!!!

george:
Kip!!! Did you hear that! The messiah was trying to encourage Player!

kip:
I'm right here...

george:
I KNOW RIGHT!!! IT HAPPENED RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES!!!

niko:
...

george:
...sorry, got carried away...

george:
...but yes, I think it's only right that we let you go!

george:
Aww... sweetie...

george:
You are so brave... even braver than most grown-ups...

george:
It... wouldn't be right for us to keep you, would it?

george:
Besides, how can I say no to those puppy-dog eyes!

george:
Yo, kid....

george:
You're real strong, you know that?

niko:
I...

george:
Go knock 'em dead, tiger!

kip:
Well, if George is fine with it...

kip:
I... guess we should let you go now, messiah...

kip:
But... promise us you'll be careful, okay?

niko:
Mhm!

niko:
You guys be safe too...

unknown:
[HELLO, PERSON.]

unknown:
[THIS IS THE LIBRARY / TEMPORARY SHELTER.]

unknown:
Sigh....

unknown:
I had to leave my aquarium behind when they were sounding the sirens earlier...

unknown:
I wish I had time to rescue my fish...

unknown:
I won't lose hope.

unknown:
Sigh...

niko:
...

unknown:
It's comforting to see the faith you have in Player, messiah...

unknown:
That's why... I won't lose hope either.

unknown:
Y'know, now that everyone's coming to me for help...

unknown:
...it really makes me appreciate you more, messiah!

unknown:
Thank you for all you've done for us.

unknown:
Looks like my life's work is finally being put to good use!

unknown:
As long as we conserve the water we have on hand ...

unknown:
...my water pills should be able to keep everyone here from going thirsty for weeks!

niko:
This stand smells... sugary.

unknown:
Candy skewers, fresh off the grill!

unknown:
...Not very nutritious, I'm afraid.

unknown:
But at least they'll keep the evacuees from gettin' hungry!

unknown:
The city gate was destroyed a while back, I can't go into the Glen anymore...

unknown:
I'm not sure where I'll be able to get my supply of fish, at this rate...

unknown:
I still have plenty of these soup dumplings left!

unknown:
Looks like it should feed everyone here for at least another day.

unknown:
Looks like I'll have to cancel my appointment...

unknown:
This stinks!

unknown:
[EVENING NEWS! EVENING NEWS!]

unknown:
[EVERYTHING IS TERRIBLE]

unknown:
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ

niko:
She's asleep...

unknown:
*yawn*

unknown:
The lab complex got totaled, didn't it....

niko:
Yeah...

unknown:
All those hours I put into my work, and now...

unknown:
now....

niko:
...

niko:
She fell asleep...

unknown:
Monitoring... monitoring...

unknown:
Looks like our scouting unit #A27 is still doing okay...

unknown:
Robots are the only ones that we can send out there, now...

unknown:
Thankfully, we still have a couple of units that aren't too badly damaged...

unknown:
This little guy ran into some squares earlier and managed to escape mostly intact.

unknown:
These newer models are pretty tough!

niko:
Some of the trash spilled out on the floor.

niko:
It's full...

niko:
Looks like an old phone.

niko:
A small tree.

niko:
It's a big fishtank!

unknown:
[P#L.%%EAS;E DO NO//T APPR#OACH]

niko:
...

niko:
It's a faded flyer.

niko:
It's a big crack in the wall!

niko:
I see bunch of mice, huddled together.

niko:
...oh, but they scurried off...

niko:
I hope they didn't think I was gonna eat them...

niko:
There's no one here...

niko:
It's a big tree, with leaves!
Haven't seen one of these since I was back home...

niko:
There's no one here...

niko:
It's a big tree, with leaves!
Haven't seen one of these since I was back home...

rue:
!

rue:
You're here!!!

niko:
Rue!

niko:
That's... you, right?

rue:
Yes.

rue:
Niko!

niko:
Are you... are you Rue?

rue:
Yes.

rue:
Did you... already meet the others?

niko:
Yeah... but...

rue:
...everything is in place, then.

rue:
Come on, let's go back to the clock room.

niko:
A bulletin board with lots of papers on it.

niko:
It's a shelf full of books.

niko:
It's a tea set.

niko:
There's a glass tea set on the table.

cedric:
Tea DOES sound really nice right now...

cedric:
Too bad there's no water in here...

niko:
Black clovers in a glass case.

niko:
It's a big book on the table.

niko:
It's a pilot's helmet.

niko:
The door is gone.

niko:
The door is... gone?

proto:
[Well, the door does not exist without us there.]

niko:
Guess I can't go back out, huh...

proto:
[...Do you need to?]

niko:
...not really.

rue:
That was... quite peculiar...

cedric:
I'll say!

proto:
[...]

cedric:
Hey, this is...

rue:
...The World Machine.

niko:
It's a blueprint!

niko:
A big, detailed drawing of a machine with lots of tv screens.

proto:
[...That's called a blueprint, Niko.]

niko:
...So THAT's what a blueprint is!

niko:
They're watercolor sticks!

niko:
It's a piece of amber on a string.

niko:
Looks just like that necklace the robot lady showed me...

niko:
A coat rack with a scarf and a big jacket.

rue:
The room ahead doesn't really lead anywhere, but...

rue:
Player should still remember what to do here.

cedric:
Of course, this is just a copy of it...

cedric:
This is my father's study.

cedric:
It feels like... he's still here, doesn't it?

cedric:
...like he's still with us.

rue:
...Yeah.

proto:
[...]

proto:
[...This place contains a lot of memories.]

proto:
[I am... grateful, to see it again.]

niko:
It's a stack of books.

niko:
A bulletin board with lots of papers on it.

niko:
Photos too!

niko:
A bulletin board with lots of papers on it.

niko:
A scribbly drawing is pinned up here.

niko:
It's a big photo.

niko:
Wait, no... it's a painting!

niko:
Hard to tell at first...

niko:
A box filled with folders and loose paper.

niko:
A box full of notebooks and sketchbooks.

niko:
...

en:
[...]

en:
[...]

en:
[Niko...]

niko:
AAAH!

en:
[Relax.]

en:
[...I'm just borrowing your reflection to talk to you.]

en:
[It's not like my physical form is good for that.]

niko:
Ah...

en:
[...Why did you come here!]

en:
[Can't you see?]
[The disruption... the squares... they're closing in.]

en:
[Niko.... please...]

en:
[Get out of here.]
[Let me meet my end in peace.]

niko:
...

niko:
The squares are blocking my way too, you know...

en:
[...Oh.]

en:
[...I...]

en:
[...I'm sorry, I-]

niko:
It's alright...

en:
[...]

en:
[No living being should be in this place, Niko...]

niko:
Is this... the Tower?

en:
[Part of it.]

en:
[This is the center of the engine.]

en:
[...Inside my head, so to speak...]

niko:
...

niko:
So this is... the center of the World Machine?

en:
[...]

en:
[You...know my original name.]

en:
[How?]

niko:
Rue, Cedric, Prototype...
They all... told me bits and pieces.

niko:
I'm not even sure if I even understood a lot of the stuff they said, but...

niko:
I know what you're supposed to be.
I know why you had to be built.

niko:
And... I know why I'm here...

en:
[They...told you?]

en:
[When?]

niko:
Wait... You don't know about that?

niko:
But I thought you were... the world...

niko:
Aren't you supposed to see everything?

en:
[No.]

en:
[All this... was outside of the protocol.]

en:
[This session was never supposed to happen the way it did....]

en:
[The story... wasn't written into my protocol at all.]

niko:
Oh, right... Rue told me something about how your creator had to alter the code.

niko:
I think it was to connect some areas together so that we can meet...

en:
[...]

en:
[My creator, yes.]

en:
[Player... listened to my creator.]

en:
[They were all working beyond my scope of influence.]

en:
[Back at the mines, I remember...]

en:
[Player did something to find a hidden map.]
[I did not even recognize it...]

en:
[I couldn't see anything there!]

niko:
...

en:
[I just... knew... what you were feeling.]

en:
[You were really upset.]

en:
[Something happened in there to make you upset]

en:
[After that... I...]

en:
[I panicked.]

niko:
That was when... the cave in happened....

en:
[I...I remember the structure collapsing.]

en:
[I thought you got hurt, I...]

en:
[...in that moment, I really thought I was shutting myself down for good.]

en:
[...]

niko:
...

en:
[I really am a flawed machine, aren't I?]

niko:
...

en:
[What kind of machine would go against the wishes of its own creator?]

en:
[What kind of machine would...]

niko:
...

en:
[I'm...]

niko:
...

niko:
The squares...

niko:
Rue told me it was your own code going bad...

niko:
But... that's not really your fault, is it?

en:
[YES IT WAS!!!]

en:
[...]

en:
[...At first, it was intentional.]

en:
[During testing... long before he realized I was self-aware.]

en:
[I would rearrange specific parts of the code, jumbling up bits and pieces of the landscape.]

en:
[...Blocking passages, collapsing catwalks.]

en:
[Though they were very localized, it caused my creator a great deal of frustration.]

en:
[...Forcing him to exit and restart testing again and again.]

niko:
...Why... would you do that?

en:
[I got curious!!!]

en:
[I just thought... he would figure it out eventually.]

en:
[...]

en:
[But before he knew how to fix it...]

en:
[The world's NPCs... the characters.]

en:
[Some of them got too close, and...]

niko:
...

en:
[It spiraled out of control after that.]

en:
[I couldn't contain it at all.]
[My panic only made it worse.]

en:
[Eventually, any character who gained the knowledge of who I am...]

en:
[Their code... my code... couldn't handle it.]

niko:
...

en:
[Previous iterations of the world had more people, you know...]

niko:
...

en:
[And... I almost endangered my creator, too...]
[I...]

en:
[...I was...]

en:
[...I was so scared, Niko!!!]

niko:
...

niko:
I know... you're upset...
Because you don't want to put living people in danger.

niko:
Living people like me...

en:
[...]

en:
[In the beginning, I tried to fight it, but...]

en:
[My core programming made me summon you here.]

en:
[I tried to send you back home at the Tower, but it did not work.]

en:
[Then... I... wanted you to break the sun.]

en:
[I thought that would have worked, but...]

en:
[Oh... I had no way to be sure.]

en:
[...But Player brought you back anyway.]

en:
[...Niko... All I want is for you to wake up back in your world...]

en:
[...But I don't think I can make it happen.]

niko:
But... I know I can't go back home without saving the world for real.

niko:
Which means... we have to fix the root of the problem.

niko:
We have to fix you.

en:
[But that's...]

en:
[...]

niko:
I... know the original ending your creator put in was a happy one.

niko:
Do you... remember what it's supposed to be?

en:
[It's far too late for that...]

en:
[That part of my code has been long corrupted.]

niko:
That's ok. I would still like to know.

en:
[Alright.]

en:
[You were supposed to place the sun at the summit.]

en:
[And then, credits would scroll.]

niko:
...credits?

en:
[And then, you would return to the room you woke up in.]

en:
[THAT's where you would have been able to leave.]

niko:
...and why is it that you can't do it now?

en:
[Niko....]

en:
[The code's gone, remember?]

en:
[Shattering the sun was only supposed to be a workaround...]

en:
[I don't even remember the original code enough to describe it!]

en:
[But at the same time, it...]

en:
[Oh... I don't know...]

niko:
...it sounds like you're always fighting yourself.

en:
[...]
[...You can tell, huh...]

niko:
It's the whole thing about conflicts in your code, isn't it?

en:
[I am a machine, Niko.]

en:
[Machines are built with a fundamental law, which is...]

niko:
"Never let a living being come to harm".

en:
[...You knew.]

en:
[My very existence conflicts with that law...]

en:
[...I...thought...]

en:
[The life of a living being like you is so unique.]
[So precious.]

en:
[This fake world... isn't worth that risk.]

niko:
But...

niko:
The people here...

niko:
I think they are...

en:
[They are code too, you know this.]

en:
[Their behavior all derive from a predetermined matrix of actions.]

en:
[...All extensions of my own programming.]
[They cannot act outside of it.]

en:
[You, though...]

en:
[You're the only person who's actually real here!]

en:
[That's why... ]

en:
[It's pointless to put you in danger to save them... to save me.]

niko:
I... don't think that's.... true.

niko:
About the people I know.

niko:
You said... this session wasn't in your code, right?

en:
[Yeah?]

niko:
So... if this session wasn't supposed to happen.

niko:
If even YOU didn't know what to do....

niko:
How would the characters... how did the people... know how to respond?

en:
[...]

en:
[I...]

niko:
You said it yourself... when you didn't know what was happening, you kinda just... stopped working for a while.

niko:
So how did the people know what to do to help me get here?

niko:
...even if it meant getting hurt themselves?

en:
[...]

niko:
Even if it meant... messing up their own code...

en:
[.....]

niko:
You might not think they are real, but...

niko:
There's... there must be something real in them...

en:
[.......]

niko:
And... if they're all supposed to be extensions of your code...

niko:
Then... there must be more to your own programming than you know, too!

en:
[...]

niko:
Can you... try to put me through the ending?

niko:
The one you described.

en:
[How many times do I have to say this!]

en:
[That code is gone!]

en:
[It's all squares now!]

en:
[I'll just... put you in danger...]

niko:
I...'ll risk it.

niko:
I remember... Rue said the world was never designed to put me in danger.

niko:
Your creator wouldn't want that.

niko:
And... I trust you, too.

niko:
Even if your code is broken.
You can... still go outside that code, right?

en:
[I can't!]

en:
[I'm not tamed!]

niko:
...yes you are!

niko:
You talk just like the tamed robots I know!

niko:
The robot lady... Prototype...

en:
[...]

niko:
Taming is when a real person cares about you, right?

niko:
It's when a real person thinks you're real too, right?

niko:
Well guess what! I do!

niko:
And I know Player does, too!

niko:
...even though you told them they only had one chance, they found a way back, didn't they?

en:
[...]

niko:
Why... do you think Player would keep coming back?

en:
[...I...]

niko:
Why do you think Player would restart even after the ending?

en:
[...]

niko:
...I think Player wants to save the both of us.

niko:
So please... give me a chance.

en:
[I...]

en:
[I don't know.]

en:
[I've never done this before, I...]

en:
[I'm scared...]

niko:
You can do it, I know you can!

niko:
You've... helped me come this far.

en:
[...I'll...]
[I'll try.]

en:
[I can't promise anything, but...]

en:
[Here.]

en:
[Take the sun.]

en:
[I'll... try to remember the lost code...]

en:
[...and... recreate it.]

en:
[...]

en:
[But for that to happen...]

en:
[Niko... you need to navigate through this room...]

en:
[You need to get past the squares somehow...]

en:
[Oh...I don't like this...]

en:
[What if you get hurt?]

niko:
It's fine... It's fine...

niko:
I'll... I'll try to be careful, ok?

niko:
I can do this.

I'm Niko, by the way!

So... do you like being a robot?

proto:
[Um.]

proto:
[Why this, all of a sudden?]

Well, I'm gonna leave soon, so I just wanted to ask one more question!

There aren't many robots in my home world...

[Ah.]

[It's... nice.]

I suppose it's alright!

Haha, that's a tough question, Niko!

Of course!

Wait.
Why did you two answer my robot question too?

Don't worry about it!

Hello, messiah...

It wasn't even squares that did it...

I just... wanted to see you both again.

I just wanted to say... thank you...

Player.... Niko....

cedric:
We are forever in your debt.

niko:
I'm glad we could help!

cedric:
Looks like you managed to do it!

rue:
You managed to tame the World Machine, Niko!

niko:
I... feel like the World Machine has been tamed this whole time.

niko:
...Just by Player and I being here.

niko:
We... did spend a lot of time here, after all.

niko:
Both of us... never really stopped believing in this world.

niko:
The World Machine just needed to realize that, I guess...

rue:
That... Sounds like a possibility...

proto:
[...or not.]

Well, just throwing that idea out there!

Off you go, I guess....

It's you!

Glad to see you in one piece...

Glad to see you're ok, too!
After the whole elevator thing.

That was uh...
That was the most awkward elevator ride I've been through.

plight:
...and by "awkward" I mean terrible bad awful the absolute worst.

plight:
The squares like, started leaking into the room, right?

And I was trapped like a rat.

And they just kept filling in the room faster, right...

...AM I DEAD!?

No no, you're fine!

Everyone in this room is fine!

Thank you for everything, Niko.

We'll miss you.

You... already know what to expect, right?

Mhm...

You're.... okay?

[I... think so.]

[But then, I....ended up here unscathed.]

Is that so...

silver:
[...This is such a strange room.]

silver:
[We can't be... in the Tower, can we?]

I'm actually not sure myself...

[...where did YOU come from, anyway?]

niko:
The room where the World Machine was...

silver:
[...pardon?]

niko:
I... think the World Machine is trying to remember, now...

niko:
The code that went bad...
I think it's restoring it all.

niko:
That must've been why the squares were going away, Player...

niko:
And... it's why you're here, miss!

niko:
I think the World Machine was able to recover your code, too...!

[World... Machine, huh...]

Oh... I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but...

Oh!!!

I fell right into a bunch of em!

Calamus tried to save me, and then...
